# Threat Models

I will use Nancy as an example. Nancy is a registered nurse who has access to patients information. In order to acces the patients infoormation, she has to enter in a password. To give the patients medication, she has to verify the indentity of the patients. She is on social media while at work.

#Attack Surfaces
Social media is the biggest hole. When she gets frustrated with a certain patient, she might end up posting the situation online. If the facility doent's force co-workers to update password, she might be vulnerable to attacks from peopl who have comprised her passowrd.

#Adversaries
Random internet trolls. Security checkers. People who are after the patients, like the media.

#Attack Vectors
Emails, social media.

#Mitigations
Never post anything related to work on social media no matter what! Change passwords frequently.

# Part 2 - Practical Security

I understand that am going to to be a really big target. Probably not from a governement sponsor but from alot of random actors. So, I have to use different password for everything. Use long password. Give the least permission as possible to mitigate risk exposure. Also, i Will never answer correctly, when a site asks for incase you forget password questions, whats your mothers middle name, as an example.
