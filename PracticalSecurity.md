1. Set up a password manager..looked into LastPass and Keepass
While I am pretty good about not using the same password, some sites invariably get the same pwd..I have just thought up a way to change this. I'll be making that change after finishing this.

2. I already use 2 factor auth for all banking and finance related transactions
Also...I NEVER log into my bank on my phone....only from my desktop...rarely from my laptop..and NEVER if I'm not home. I realize this isn't the best security setup..at least it averts
and precludes a few attack vectors from being possibly exploited.

3. I'll have to look into sandboxed environments and VMs...I'll be using the resources in the readme.md file to read up on this more.
