Promotion in a Big Wide Web

Social media gives you the opportunity to market yourself, obtain justice and connect with others. Posting heavy content (images, personal informaion, etc) however, gives advertisers an opportunity to to send you content you may not have been asking for. Others users may take your content, (like take a photo and pose as you), and can use your name to phish personal information from those you are connected to and others.
