Hello All,

I just wanted to bring to everyone's attention a couple of security related threats that we need to recognize, given our clientele.

Our typical clients include young mothers with toddlers/infants. Obviously, they are quite concerned about the security of their newborns and toddlers.
Our services to them include advice on young mother related issues, baby's health, mom's health and our website serves as a one stop shop for them so they 
don't have to search all over the internet for resources they want/need. This puts us in a position of responsibility..not only for their well-being..but 
also for their online security. In essense we have to worry about the following:

1. Attack surface: This comprises of the many ways that young mothers can have their information/privacy breached and misused. Threats do not have to be
  online only but can surface in other areas too. Young mothers tend to buy stuff for their babies..so their credit card could be exposed. They could be 
  victims of phishing through emails/articles/social media etc. They could also be exposed to physical threats. More on this next.

2. Adversaries: Typically you'd think of cyber criminals who wants access to her identity and or credit cards, personal info. However, consider the case of 
  a young mother who's out shopping with her toddler/s..she could be an easy target for someone who just wants to grab her purse and run. A young mother is
  very unlikely to leave behind her toddler or young baby to run after a purse thief. So we need articles on our website which alert her to this possibility.

3. Attack Vectors: This is typically a list, not exhaustive, of the number of specific things a young mother needs to be aware of.
  a) Her phone...Pictures of her babies and other family members..posts about when she is planning to go back to work...or be out of the house coule potentially
  alert someone to when the house might be empty. Another risk is her pictures being geotagged and some nefarious actor piecing together her daily pattern.
  b) Her computer/Tablet etc..which she might use to peruse our site amongst others. While we can't protect every young mother individually, it is absolutely our
  responsibility to at least make sure that all outside links from our website are clean...by this I mean we should not provide a link to other webpages where
  security is lax and we're not sure how valid the website is.
  c) Person: As outlined above, her person is also an attack vector...we can at least make sure that a young mother is aware of this threat and is informed.
  d) Toys: Toys for babies/toddlers..webcams etc are increasingly internet connected and pose significant concerns

5. Mitigations: Its not all doom and gloom..there are a number of protections a young mother can use to barricade herself sufficiently. While it would be impossible
  to exhaustively list all the protections we should absolutely list articles for her consumption which alert her to most threat vectors.
  a) she needs to remove the geotagging feature on her phone pictures...or at least be aware of it
  b) she can be more careful about specific times and dates that she posts os social media
  c) use a password manager to protect her various logins
  d) Make sure all her kids toys are either protected or have the internet connectivity switched off when not needed
  e) always be aware of her personal surroundings

  I encourage each of you to think along these lines and research further in a big to make our reader/site users safer.
