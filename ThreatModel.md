A situation would be a large client's accounting department that has access to their company's bank information. They access this information online or by going to the bank and making deposits. Millions of dollars worth of transactions are processed everyday. Potential adversaries would be criminals intent on stealing this money. A potential problem would be password theft. Accounting has passwords to the online bank account and writing a password on a sticky note or storing this data in an unncrypted file can be risky. Banks can solve this issue by providing a separate security token to only a few employees that generally use the banking system. A security token would provide another key that is necessary to access an online banking account aside from the user's password. These provides a double security measure since a criminal would need the user's password and the physical security token to access the account.
