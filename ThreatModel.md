# Threat Model

Hello, User!

We have received your email about password leaks that has threatened your security. The attack surface could be your email or another local storage device. We advice you change your email passwords and do not open/read any email that might look like a scam to you. in addition to that someone might have attached a USB or another local storage device to your computer which might have had a keylogger on it. Keyloggers record every key that you enter in a file on the attackers storage device. To prevent keyloggers to read your input from the keyboard you can set up a firewall with which you can monitor your activity, it will allow you to give permission to use any peripheral devices attached to your computer. Another ways you can block a keylogger is to install a password manager or change your password frequently.
