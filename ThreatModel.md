## Open-Office Threat Model

Open-office design plans, like those of Google's floors filled with rows of desks where engineers work, present security risks.
Say Sam works in this type of environment at a large company, and routinely leaves her desk to visit the vending machine, restroom, etc. You name it, Sam will visit it just so she can stretch her legs for a bit and get away from the computer she's bound to.

Sam's coworker, Ben, works on the same floor, just a row behind and to the left, where he has a direct line of sight with Sam's monitor. Ben's team is working on a different project than Sam's team is, however they hold some similarities in terms of the how the technology in their projects is applied. Every time all the teams submit project reports, Sam's team's project is always put at top of the company's priority list. Ben is adamant to find out what Sam's team is doing so well so that his team can get an edge in scaling to the top of the priority list.

Ben notices that when Sam makes a trip away from her desk, she doesn't bother locking her workstation. Instead, she minimizes all of her open windows, leaving a clean desktop. When she's up he takes his chance and walks briskly over her workstation, sits down, and begins opening all of her minimized windows. He opens Finder and pores through her `Recents` item in the Finder sidebar, scanning all other folders for names that may allude to project-related work. One of the minimized windows happens to be a crypto-exchange site, and she's signed in to it. Ben thinks "Are her passwords anywhere?" He check the open browser's password manager, where he's presented with a long list of passwords. A notification banner scrolls across the top corner of the screen; it's Sam's aunt. She sent Sam her location via iMessage, and wrote to take care of the house over the weekend, and that the key is under the mat.

With this newfound access to simply a coworker's open workstation, Ben is presented with multiple possible attack surfaces and vectors, information-based and, with the inclusion of his knowing of an open house with a key under the front mat, an in-person threat.
A possible way Sam can prevent this from happening again is to get into the habit of locking her workstation when it leaves your line of sight while you're not seated at it. Another line of defense to keep her passwords protected would be to set up 2FA (two factor authentication) where the user must provide credentials via another device, such as a smartphone, in order to sign in.
