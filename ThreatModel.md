## Threat Model Summary

Here we are going to use a threat model to do an overview of cyber security and the vulnerabilities it is affiliated with. Hopefully this summary will give better insight to address potential weaknesses, attackers motives, and steps you can take to further strengthen your own security to prevent an attack.

## Attack Surface

Attack surface defines the environment in which you are open to an attack without proper precaution. This includes using technology that is not protected by passwords or a unique log in system, connecting to public services that do not have proper security, or using a service that does not have effective authentication. 

## Adversaries

Adversaries are those who are interested in attacking for whatever motives that will benefit themselves. Individuals included in this are wide and many, but may include hackers, criminals, pranksters, etc. Their reasons could be to obtain personal information to sell to other adversaries, obtain your information to further gain access to your financial institutions, and so. As a computer programmer you are especially susceptible to an attack, thus it is wise to take extra precaution to set up an effective security system on all devices you use.

## Attack Vectors

Attack vectors are the specific ways an attacker could compromise your security. If at any point you must use a public device, do so without accessing any personal high value resources such as online banking, etc. It is also wise to have different unique passwords for the different websites and services you access to prevent an attacker from gaining entry to all of your resources if they do crack one password.

## Mitigation

Mitigation is the process of taking steps to maximize your security and to minimize the threat of all attacks. One simple example of this is simply using different passwords for all your logins with the minimum length being at least 6, but the longer the better. You could set up a password manager on your personal devices to keep track and make it more effective. You could limit usage on public devices and avoiding using public wifi when possible. Make sure to do research on the services you use to handle very personal, valuable information and ensuring they use an effective authentication system.
