# THREAT MODEL

Bill is a web developer who works at a boutique development agency. On his free time he
has several personal projects he works on ranging from social media apps to video games.
His computer is always password protected; however, all of his logins and passwords are
saved in to the browsers and he often works at coffee shops. The main attack surface
here is his laptop, particularly being used on public wi-fi. Criminals looking to steal
his projects or personal information may have an easy time doing it over a public
network. His computer/personal information may be viewed while using public wi-fi spots.
Additionally, hackers may get his passwords and steal his potentially valuable
projects. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, he should set a different password for
everything and not use public wi-fi spots. Also, he should keep his projects backed up
and have proof of ownership in a safe place.
