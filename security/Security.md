Write 1-2 paragraphs summarizing what you did
(remember, a good security setup doesn't depend on security through obscurity,
so it should be safe to talk about it as long as you don't share actual
passwords/secrets). As a stretch goal, write a blog post about your security
setup describing what youâ€™ve learned and tips you have for others.

Running through most of these exercises made me realize I am awful in this area of security. I used the same password for mostly all my logins for various sites, and haven't changed it in years. I decided to go with a LastPass as my password manager which was extremely easy to set up and free. The master password I created LastPass is this long: *************************** being four random words and some numbers, which are easy for me to remember. I really enjoy this approach because it's actually a secure password without being extremely complicated, and I feel much safer with it.

I also use Google for many services related to my coding projects, environment, and other files, etc. So I activated my 2-Factor Authentication with that account and also stored some Temporary Passwords provided by Google on a portable USB in the case I don't have my phone on me at the time. I also set up a 2-Factor Authentication with my GitHub account as well. In reference to my GitHub account I went through the process to create GBG and SSH key for my GitHub account to ensure pure security with my environment and my machine.

I greatly appreciate this exercise as it has been an eye-opener for me in understanding how to secure myself from adversaries. So thank you! I feel much better about my state in things.
