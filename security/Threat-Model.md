Patricia is a long-time employee at Boeing. She has worked in HR for over two decades and was recently promoted to Senior Manager. Patricia is old school and only recently upgraded from a flip phone to a Samsung Galaxy S5.

Her colleagues in the department are friendly, but most are in their late 20s and all of Patricia's friends have left the company. She likes to play FarmVille on breaks.
