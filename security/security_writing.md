#### I realized after the security content from this week that some of my personal security was a bit lacking. I too had fallen into some bad security habits. I was already using 2FA on a few of my accounts(banking, email, etc), but not all of them, and I certainly hadn't considered that as a working developer I could be considered a high-value target. Probably my biggest flaw was that I was using what I considered a "complex" password, but once I realized how easy simple brute force password hacking could be, I realized it was time to revisit some of my practices.

#### As part of this security revision, I first set up 2FA on all of my dev sites(gitHub, GCP, Heroku, mLab), as well as a few others, using Google Authenticator. I also set up KeePassXC for a password manager, and switched from a password to a more secure passphrase format. In addition, I set up both my laptops to connect to gitHub using SSH. I'll continue to review my practices, but I feel like this is a good starting point.
