My wife worked for DHS in Oklahoma and will now be working with family and children's services. Much of her professional digital life involves very personal information including SSNs and possibly compromising info.

Email:

Because of the amount of client's personal information you have access to, you may possibly be at risk of losing said information depending on several factors. Places to consider where you might be compromised would include: work login systems, your phone, work phone, and places you might take your work phone. 

Considering that you almost daily visit client's homes as well as take your phone to various businesses, it would be imperitive that your information is secure if you happened to leave your phone behind. Beyond that, vindictive relatives, clients, etc could be after access to your professional logins.

It's possible you could be compromised by someone accessing your work or personal phone, phishing in emails, social engineering over your work phone.

It is very important that your passwords are unique and changed often. Beyond that, having a rule to never give out someone else's personal information over the phone would be good. I would also recommend using fingerprint or a long passcode to protect your phone. For all of your personal and professional logins I would recommend using a password manager that will generate long, unique passwords for you.
