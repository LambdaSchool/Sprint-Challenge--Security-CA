I have two-factor authentication enabled on most of my accounts. This exercise reminded me to change my Twitter password in light of the recent news that they had their security compromised. I was previously just using the inbuilt browser password managers but I am now using LastPass for them instead. I also changed the digital ocean droplet I have to use SSH. I will look into Kali Linux on a desktop I am building.
