## Part 2 - Practical Security

I got a 1Password family plan, and it's been great so far. It comes out to $1/person/month, and my mom no longer carries around a sticky note with her passwords!
I have two-factor auth set up for my email, bank and credit card accounts. And just today I connected to Github with SSH.

I've been using my fingeprint to unlock my Galaxy, but I've read that it's not very insecure so I likely will be changing back to the 7-digit PIN. I also use a VPN on my phone. 

(Thanks for all the helpful resources, Brian! Will utilize them in the near future.)
