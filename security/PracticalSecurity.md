### Personal Security

I have taken several steps toward improving my personal security.  
Some of them are as follows:  

1. 2 Factor Authentication
2. Using Bio-metric authentication on mobile devices.
2. Using Password Manager - LastPass
3. Regularly updating passphrases
4. Securing my devices using Anti-Virus software
5. Setup a private DNS (1.1.1.1)
6. Using VPN
