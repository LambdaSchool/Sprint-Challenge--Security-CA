Two Factor Auth: I set up 2 factor authentication for my Amazon account. They have been bugging me to do it for a while now, so I figured I would take care of both my Amazon security needs and my Sprint Challenge needs at the same time. The setup was pretty easy and hassle-free I provided my cell phone number as 2nd layer of authentication. When I log in to Amazon, it now sends me a text with a 6-digit code. I enter the code into a form field, and I am granted access to my account. This 2 factor auth protects should my password get stolen while making it more difficult to access the account through other nefarious methods. Now my Amazon account is as secure as my bank account...which still isn't all that great, but it's better.
