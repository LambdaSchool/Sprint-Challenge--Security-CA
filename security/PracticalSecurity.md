### Implementation of Practical Security

> I decided to set up Bitdefender. Bitdefender has been rated the best total security of 2018. It's main features include anti-ransomware,anti-ransomware, and firewall protection. The best thing is it does not stop at just your computer. Bitdefender takes care of your smartphones and any other smart device in your home or office.
