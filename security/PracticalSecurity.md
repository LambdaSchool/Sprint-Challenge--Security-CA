I decided to connect to Github using SSH instead of a password. I made separate keys for both my desktop and laptop, and after the initial setup, it turned out to be more convenient than using a password.

I also setup 2FA on my email account. SMS is not very secure, and it is possible to use social-engineering to convince phone companies to give access to criminals, but it is a step up over not having it.
