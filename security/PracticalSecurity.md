Most of my security upgrades have been through relentless prompts and warnings by Google and Apple. So for that reason, I do have two-factor authentication set up for multiple accounts and utilize a password manager. 

However, prior to today, I did not have SSH keypairs set up for GitHub and since I plan on being a software developer I thought I might as well mitigate this risk. The process was pretty straightforward. I followed the [documentation linked](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) and had the set-up completed in a matter of minutes. 

*Tip to the wise **do not skim** the ssh steps. The last step on the page actually directs you to adding the ssh to your github account*
