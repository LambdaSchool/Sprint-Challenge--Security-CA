## Security Improvements
To improve my online security I have kaspersky installed and configured the safe money tool of the application for my online financial accounts. Also, I previously used to use the same password for a lot of accounts even bank accounts, but now I am implementing encryption using a password manager. I also figured to connect to GitHub with SSH key. My firwale is now very strong and I am not allowing any unknown applications to connect to my machine. I also use 2 steps authentication for my email accounts.
