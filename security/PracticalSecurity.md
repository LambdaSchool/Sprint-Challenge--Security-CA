Keyy is a great app for 2-factor authentication. You tell it where you want to login, it gives you a QVC code, you point your phone at it while the app is running, and it automatically logs you in.

Password managers do come with some risk though. If it were ever to be compromised, then all of your information would be available at once to the attacker.
