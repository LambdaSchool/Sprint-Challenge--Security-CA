Regarding my own security, I do keep my devices locked and use two-factor authentication on my accounts. I also use a password manager, and when possible I log in to services with Google's authentication.

I need to update some of the passwords on a few accounts that are stored in my password manager because I do still have some old, less secure passwords that had been used on multiple accounts before I started using the password manager.

I also need to check some of my network equipment and make sure it's patched and up to date.

I've taken some steps today to update some of these things, and will continue to do so.
