I run 2-factor auth on everything I can. I keep all my high security passwords in a keepass vault double encrypted on dropbox and the rest of my passwords split between lastpass and google's password manager for convenience.  I keep a strict whitelist only firewall on my computers both inbound and outbound. I keep strict adblockers and antitrackers on all my browsers, and only visit through https. I also always check my pockets regularly when in public, to ensure I never lose my phone or other valuables.
