### Password Manager
It may be completely irrational, but I don't trust password managers.  I am essentially giving some company access to all my passwords under the guise of protection.  While it would be counterintuitive for a company to compromise their business by doing this, there is literally nothing stopping them.  Not to mention their code could have a security flaw in and of itself, allowing some black hat to steal all of my passwords.  I also don't save any passwords in my browser / applications (except for passwords that I don't care about like zoom or repl.it).  I don't even use my real name for things most of the time.

### Two Factor Authentication
Everything I use already has this built-in (unless I am not fully understanding two-factor authentication).  
* My bank/credit cards verify my device and password.  If I login from a difference device, it sends me an e-mail to verify I was the one trying to log in before letting me move forward.
* I don't use facebook/twitter/etc.  
* Literally everything else, I couldn't care less if it gets hacked.  Oh no, someone can edit my LinkedIn...


### SSH Keypairs for Github
I followed the directions here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key.  While I understand a keypair, I am not entirely sure how this is useful for why I am using Github.

### GPG Keypair
I am going to assume that this refers to the GnuPG information that I found.  While I saw the phrase many a time on google, trying to find the definition of a GPG keypair wasn't fruitful.  It doesn't have any information in training kit about them either, nor do I remember it being talked about.  

That being said, the more I read about them, I honestly don't see myself having a need for this in any way.  Maybe I don't understand it well enough, but this seems pretty worthless to someone like me.  Maybe if I get a job after Lambda I will need something like this, in which case I'll expect them to tell me and I will bother with it then.

### Sandboxing 
I installed a suite called Comodo that allows for browsing in a sandbox environment.

### Random Information
All of my passwords are fairly long, at least 16 characters if not more.  My passwords (despite being told this doesn't matter, the math says otherwise) are a mix of symbols, numbers, and characters.
