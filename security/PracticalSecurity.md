As I go deeper down the rabbit hole of technology I continually find my security to be lacking. I remember the days of using one weak password for all of my logins and clicking on questionable websites. Over time I have switched to using a different password for each site and making sure that they are longer, but this isn't enough.

My first order of business was *finally* downloading KeePass (which has been on the to-do list first being introduced to it). I downloaded one of the OSX ports - MacPass. My weekend project will be integrating it into my life. 

I already use SSH for github, it is great because of how convenient the CLI functionality is. I set up 2FA whenever possible. Once I move on from the MacBook Pro I currently use my next machine will run Linux (Ubuntu). This weekend I will also look into VPNs and firewalls a little deeper.

Some physical security I would like to implement is buying a safebox to keep secure items. My friend has a little magnet cover for his laptop camera which I will order today. I'd also like to get a cold storage wallet for my cryptocurrency.

The best part is that I find myself being more mindful of security issues. The changes happen slowly, but are constantly improving toward being as secure as possible.
