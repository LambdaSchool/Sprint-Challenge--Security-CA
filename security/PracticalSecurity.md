To improve my personal security I finally got LastPass (it's something I've been putting off for ages). I also changed all my bank accounts and credit cards to 2-Factor Auth and am in the process of changes all of my stored passwords to something unique and stronger using LastPass's generate password function. I also researched setting up a Virtual Machine for web browsing on my Desktop. I'm considering getting a hardware second factor, especially after I stumbled across this article: https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15946642/two-factor-authentication-online-security-mess
