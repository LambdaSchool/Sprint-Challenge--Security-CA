On the last day of work that I did in November, the Friday before I was set to start Lambda school, my cell phone was stolen. Stolen, actually, might be a strong word for what happened. I was riding my bike to work and my phone fell out of my pocket and I didn't realize it until I got to work. 

I didn't have a lock screen on my phone. 'I always keep my phone on me,' I said at the time, 'so I'm not too worried'. I probably should have thought that through a bit deeper. We don't need security for when things are going well. We need security for the times in which they are not going well. 

My phone had my passwords saved, my credit card saved, which is very convenient for when I want to make a quick purchase. It is much less convenient when my phone is unlocked and in the hands of a stranger.

I am very lucky that Google thinks that security is important, even when I don't. My phone was a Google phone and I was able to log on to my Google account from my work computer, lock my phone and send an alert to the screen, asking it to be returned to me. I was able to track my phone's movement across the city and repeatedly call it, overriding my settings that the ringer was on silent--to no avail. It became clear the person had no intention of getting my phone back to me. I was able to remotely wipe the device of all my content, even with the phone clear across town.

I say this now because, five months later, I should know better. But it wasn't until today's assignment that I actually put a screen lock on my current phone. 

To increase security, I did a full sweep of my passwords and logins. I created passwords that are much longer pass-phrases that are not written anywhere or lifted from anything. These come straight out of my brain. I instituted two-factor authentication on the majority of my platforms. I'm not great about regularly changing my passwords, so some of these had been my password since I last reset them in November.
