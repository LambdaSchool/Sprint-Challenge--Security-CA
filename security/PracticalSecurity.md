As someone who is deeply interested in blockchain and cryptography, I take my personal cyber security very seriously. All of my passwords are completely random, long, and could only be guessed by me. As I am paranoid about getting hacked, anything related to financial account logins, whether it's my bank accounts or cryptocurrency exchanges, my passwords have been written down on paper and hidden in a secure, undisclosed place. They are not stored digitally anywhere. It's not the most convenient method, but it's the most secure. Even if someone would find these passwords, which would be very difficult, they would also have to guess my username, which I have memorized in my head. In addition, passwords and logins for these accounts are all different. I also use 2FA for all of these accounts via the apps Authy & Google Auth, and I also have email notifications letting me know each time there is a login in to one of these accounts as well as any time money is withdrawn.

I do keep less sensitive login / passwords encrypted on my computer (meaning if that account got hacked, it wouldn't be a dire situation), but I will be taking steps to use KeePass or the like for those. All of my e-mail address and social media account logins are memorized in my head and not stored anywhere. Again, not the most convenient solution, but the most secure.

At the moment, I don't have any repos on GitHub that are worth hacking and doing anything with, but I will be taking steps to secure my account with SSH and perhaps GPG later on.

Lastly, if I use public WIFI, I use a VPN, and I generally opt out of using public WIFI on my phone. I've watched some interesting videos of John McAfee talking about keylogger hacks via public WIFI on mobile devices.

In general, I feel I have taken steps to make it inconvenient for an attacker to hack me. Essentially, anyone can be hacked with enough coordination and resources, but it's likely that an attacker would move on to an easier target than spending time and effort trying to hack me.
