I implemented SSH to use with my Github or to use with other servers in the future I may interact with. SSH is more secure since it generates a symmetrically encrypted keypair using asymmetric encryption and hashing. Combined with RSA, I can connect to my Github account without using my password.

Another security feature I decided to implement for fun is setting up alerts in some of my documents using a token. When someone opens the file searching for my private data, I will be notified that the file was opened as well as the location of the attacker.
