# Part 2 - Practical Security

As software developer I have several security habits and layers.

I will start for a anti virus that can check also web browser threads such a adwares
malwares or trojans.

Also I always check unknown links before click on it.

I do not have a password manager I rather having several complicated passwords than 
a single place where all my passwords are. 
I think never is good idea to have one place of source for passwords.

For websites that offer 2FA I always activate them it seems quite difficult having 
all the things in place in order to perform a hack.

Github I always use ssh.

GPG is a new concept to me. I wil apply this in the future.
 
I do have virtual box to run locally any environment.

I have a single computer with Kali linux to browse internet anonymously
and to test my network seeing all the possible weird connections or process
I may have.
