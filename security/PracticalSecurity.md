My Security Plan

I eschewed password managers because of the lack of user-friendly mobile
applications, but am planning to try them again once I get a job. The other
security measure I'm planning to implement post-job is a yubi-key to protect
my most sensitive accounts. I didn't know about the GitHub SSH keys, so 
that I will also try and implement in the near future. 

For me, security includes a balance of convenience. And at this point in my
life, I value convenience more than better security. But after I do become
a developer and develop public apps, I'll probably value my security a bit
more, and give up some convenience for it :).
