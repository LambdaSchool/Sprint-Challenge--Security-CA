- I am quite proactive in maintaining my security, so I have a lot of preventative measures put in place already. On my most important accounts, I have a 2 factor authentication when logging into anywhere new. I took a look at the _Two Factor Auth_ list and switched many of my accounts to have two factor auth enabled, especially when it comes to my gaming accounts. 
Many of my passwords are not words, but rather a set of letters, numbers, and symbols that only make sense to me. Despite that fact, I decided to use _KeePass_ to store everything, as its hard to remember all my passwords sometimes. This will make things more secure, and more convenient as well when it comes to all my account passwords I have to manage.
