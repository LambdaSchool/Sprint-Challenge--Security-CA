I already use a password manager and two-factor authentication (where possible), but I did have some vulnerability in the fact that I have not updated all of my accounts to use it fully.

I spent some time going through my stored accounts, finding the ones that still used old passwords, and updated them to use random passwords created by the PW manager. I also found other accounts that I hadn't added to it, then added them and updated those passwords as well.

Additionally I found a couple accounts that had a two-factor authentication option that wasn't enabled, so I added it.
