I have set up two factor authentication anywhere that I can. I use google's password manager to store my passwords and tend to use a different password for each site/application. I have very strong passwords and I also change them every couple of months to be extra careful. I tend to avoid shopping online already and will continue to do so in the future. I have antivirus and antimalware installed on all of my computers and I have educated my wife to the point that she asks me before she downloads anything or proceeds to skecthy sites. I use https sites whenever possible and am looking into doing a WSL install to help better my overall system security. I have a vpn as well to ensure that my IP address is not visible to outsiders when Im on the internet.
