1.  The first measure I took to make myself more secure was to change my passwords to be much stronger, and to differentiate them over the various services I use.   I also based the strenth and character length of passwords to match the sensitivity of the information.  For social media accounts where I do not post much personal information, family pictures, times and locations of events ect; I made a strong, but somewhat memorizable password.    For emails and other more personal applications, the passwords are of a sufficient length and variety to need a seperate, highly secured file in which to store this information.   Banking and other information takes this even further, as far as types of characters employed, and length of string.

2. I arranged the file system on my computer to reflect personal interests.  In this way it would be difficult to tell exactly what information was on my various drives, whether internal or external.   To some degree, I did this with the file arrangements within my various drives as well.  I also organized and moved information on my external drives to be more specific to each drive, and I found a more secure physical way to store and arrange these drives when not being actively used.
