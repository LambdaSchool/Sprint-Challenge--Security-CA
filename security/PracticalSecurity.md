## Part 2 - Practical Security

To improve my personal security setup, I have taken several steps.

I currently use a few password managers. Depending on the importance of the online account, I will use one of their long, randomly generated passwords. 

I have 2FA enabled on every single account that allows it. Authy is my authenticator app of choice. 

My phone and laptop are password protected. I use MacOS's FileValut feature in order to encrypt my startup disk. I also password protect my external harddrives which contain anything useful. My media drives however are not protected, but I do not think it is necessary.

I have several "spam" and "throwaway" email accounts if I need to sign up for anything that I do not fully trust.

I also have a spare laptop that has never been used for anything important. I use this in case I need to test something out but want to keep it separate from my main computers. I often run different OSes off USB drives on this laptop as well. 

I remember wanting a YubiKey after reading about it for the first time a while back but I never did purchase one. I may get one soon now that I am reminded of it.

I have actually been deciding on a Linux distro to install on my desktop recently. I was leaning towards Mint, but I may have to do some digging into Kali now.

Finally, I just set up a GPG key on my GitHub account. While obviously impossible to completely eliminate all risk of an attack, I believe that these steps definitely help minimize the chances of being compromised.
