I like to think that I am reasonably secure, but there were a couple of aspects that needed improvement. For one, I put a password pattern on my phone, as previously there was no lock screen. I use an outdated version of windows, so it would likely be in my best interest to upgrade to a more modern distribution with up-to-date security. I use two-factor auth on a few of my services but have since found several that have the option to opt-in.
