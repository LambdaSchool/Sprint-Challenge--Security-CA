# Personal Computer Security

### What I added to my setup to help enhance the security of my personal network computer system

#### In today's word the threats are everything, so after learning how vulnerable I really am, I decided to add some additional software and features to further enhance the difficulty to gaining valuable data from my person. Granted there is no way to 100% protect any network, there are steps you an take to make it harder, and less rewarding, for someone with malicious intent to gain access to your information.

#### Below are the steps I took to further protect myself:

* Installed [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com) - This will actually run right in your browser. I like that it takes you through the steps of setting up all your other accounts by finding them automatically. There are alternatives out there if you would like one stored locally, but for me this works as I can use it from other computers and networks.

There wasn't much else for me that I could do. I wanted to add 2FA to my bank, but unfortunately they don't offer it. I did make the valiant effort to inform them I would like it though :)

I also wanted to add kali linux to my Virtual Box, as I have used it on other systems before and loved the security options. Unfortunately the computers I am using now do not have the resources to run virtual box. I do plan on getting a better computer in the future, along with putting linux on a junk machine that may be laying around.
