##Security## 
  A fun topic for me as it has been something in my life a long time. I started young in computers, and cryptography was one of my hobbies I loved how I could write, what looked like nonsence to others, but with the right page out of my cryptography book you could decipher it. This experience leading into how I hand personal accounts and security.
  I dont think much is secure, as this is just a bunch of on and off states, and since security is not just on and off, its impossible to be totally secure using a computer. I think using secure measure is the best you can hope for. Changing passwords into pass phrases. Changeing pass phrase often helps to harden your security measures. 
  Security, is more than the passphrases you use, its how you intereact on the web altogether. Any site can be a potential security problem, the question is how much can you mitigate the damage, and/or prevent known attack patterns.
  
  Change your passwords!!!
