## Personal Practical Security

Perhaps sadly, and for the longest time, I used the same password for *nearly* all my accounts. How was I supposed to remember all my passwords? Also, forgetting and doing password resets wasn't worth the hassle.  

This was my state untill recently, when I learned of **password managers**. Or rather, finally took a serious look at them. As of now, I still don't know if I'm been compromised from any of my accounts, but I took a `secure` leap and began using LastPass, a hand-dandy password manager. 

With LastPass I have all (well... almost all), my passwords securely saved in one place. I have a different password for every application that needs login info. These passwords are long, randomly generated passwords. Also, I don't have to type passwords in. LastPass does this for me, which avoids hacking via keystroke logs in the password forms. I also have a second security feature (when using mobile) by using my fingerprint to login to LastPass instead of typing in the `master password`.

I now feel much safer, and easier to login actually! Here's to new beginnings of personal practical security.
