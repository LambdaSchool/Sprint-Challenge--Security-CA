I think I already have good enough security.. using Apple products many of the services that come stock with these devices is encrypted. I can feel secure in sending messages in iMessage due to the strong encryption Apple employs for this service. Otherwise, all my passwords are atleast 12 characters in length, and contain a variety of symbols. I also tested my passwords (not the actual passwords, but the same character type set) in an online test to make sure itll take a brute force hacker more than a month with a program to crack. Passwords are a big deal in todays age, don't let your stuff get hacked because your password is password.
