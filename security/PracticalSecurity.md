# Part 2 - Practical Security

Do something to improve your personal security setup - if you’re not using a
password manager, set one up. If you’re doing that, then set up two factor for
some of your accounts. If you’re doing that, then set up proper SSH keypairs for
services that support it (e.g. GitHub). And you can keep going - set up a GPG
keypair, consider simple dedicated hardware for second factor, set up a trusted
computer/VM running only open source software, set up a "sandboxed" environment
for web browsing that doesn't save state, etc.

I will be using two factor authentication for my github account. Previously I only used a password. I'll be changing my password to a passphrase made up of several words combined that do not make much a coherent sentence. I will also start using an open source password manager
