I instituted 2FA for 3 different sites that I use. I also downloaded the latest Kali distro and experimented with some of the utilities such as *dotdotpwn* (web site directory recursion exploit finder), *metasploit* (a powerful suite of tools that attempts to find exploits on target systems), *pdfcrack*, and *hydra* (a web site password extraction tool). And I updated the firmware on my router and conducted both internal and external port scans using *nmap* with different scan vectors -- SYN, SYN floods, TCP ports, UDP ports, and OS fingerprinting.

Additionally, I setup an Ubuntu 18.04 VM using VMWare Player specifically as a sandbox container for certain apps, such as internet browsers, in order to contain file downloads that will be scanned and tested before trusted on production systems.
