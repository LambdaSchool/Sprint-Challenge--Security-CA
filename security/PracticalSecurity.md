I didn't technically have time to get to this, but I will write about what I will be doing. I had a password manager in the past and I got rid it because it was annoying, so I will be going back to having one as soon as I decide which one I want to use. It will probably KeePass. I currently use Two-factor auth on some of my accounts so I will go and add it to the rest that offer it. I don't know that I want to go any further than that quite yet because I don't completely understand them and before I use something I'd like to understand it.
