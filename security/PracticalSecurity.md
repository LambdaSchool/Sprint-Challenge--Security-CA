To ensure my own personal security online as much as possible, I have taken a few steps. First of all, I started using a password manager. A password manager generates unique, long, and complex passwords for all of your accounts. You simply remember one, long and complex password, or use biometrics, to unlock your password manager, which you can then copy and paste passwords from, for each account as you need to log in. Another layer of security, is that I enabled two factor authentication for every service I use that offers it. Two factor authentication (2FA), requires a secondary device be used in conjunction with your login username and password, in order to log in to a system. Upon log in attempt, the system will send a unique code to your secondary device, which you also must enter, in order to log in. I have also set up GitHub with SSH.
