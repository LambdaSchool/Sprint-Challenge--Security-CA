My highest security risks are having a compromised connection, keyloggers, and malware. A few of my accounts on certain websites have fallen to brute force attacks after those websites have fallen to security breaches. In order to control the damage, passwords will have to be different for every single website. I could keep all the passwords written down, but this would be a huge risk if the paper was stolen or lost. One slight alternative is to write them down but ciphered so only I could understand what I wrote.
