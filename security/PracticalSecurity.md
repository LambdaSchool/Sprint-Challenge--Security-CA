I have already been using 2 factor auth for my accounts for a few years now. 
I was using google authenticator because I was not aware that there were other options. 
When my phone stopped working one day I had a difficult time trying to recover my accounts but eventually got all of them back except my coinbase account (I had to make a new one, and fortunately I didn't have any funds in the old account).
Since then I have switched to Authy for 2-factor authentication so if my phone fails I still have access to Authy on my PC and vise-versa.  
  
I can't think of any accounts off the top of my head that I don't have 2FA linked with, but in the future I will use Keepass for accounts that don't support 2FA.
I will also try to get SSH set up tonight with github.
