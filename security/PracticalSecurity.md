# Practical Security

For some of my accounts I was already using two factor auth. I learned how to setup SSH keypairs with GitHub. I'm running Mac Os sierra as a virtual machine through VMware on my Windows desktop PC. I'll be looking up how to install Ubuntu in VirtualBox. I did install Kali linux a while ago on VMware but didn't really know what to do with it.
