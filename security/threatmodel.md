Think of a threat model - a situation with a user (or type of user) and a
context that frames their personal security preferences and situation. Concepts
you should consider (and a few examples of each) include:

- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

Write a summary of the overall situation as if you were going to send it as a
professional email to explain it to a coworker. Please turn in a file
`ThreatModel.md` with 1-2 paragraphs addressing the above concepts in a concise
fashion.

As the perception of workspace changes, we need to be aware what role we play in keeping our workspace secure.  When we are in the office and away from our desks, our computer should be locked and screen blank.  Even those that work from home should do this as well.  You never know if a guest could have ulterior motives.  Even if they want to pull a prank, it could get out to the public and shake confidence in the company. When using tablets, computers, and phones in public spaces be careful not to send private information through public wifi.  Criminals could use the information for blackmail or sell our information to a competitor.  Be mindful about passwords. Don't write down passwords or have a file called passwords on your device.  When creating passwords make it unique and something that people can't guess.  Replace letters with numbers or symbols. For example Tiffany could become #i$$a*Y.  Change your password often at least every 30-90 days. If private information needs to be sent make sure that it is always encrypted. Make sure access cards are not left unattended.  If yours gets lost let us know right away.  That way it can get deactivated and a new card reordered.
