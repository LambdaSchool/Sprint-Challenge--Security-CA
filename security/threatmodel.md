Hello Aaron,

We recently talked about possible changes to your OPSEC, since you work in a relatively new company that hasn't really laid out any ground rules this can be a daunting task to undertake, but rest assured that once this becomes a habit it no longer is so hard to inspire this change with your co-workers as well. Since your job consists of being on a computer doing banking duties I highly suggest not to plug in any outside USB's only allow for use of such storage devices if they are provided by the firm. Remember to remain vigilant and always check with upper management and verify IT routine checkups. The reason why I highlight this is because you want to make sure that the people that come to check on your devices is indeed the firm's IT and not an outsider with sinister motives. Remember to keep a close eye on people who visit the bank, observe their mannerisms to see if they are taking pictures or staying too long doing nothing. Mitigations to the following scenarios are relatively easy if you remember to always be aware of your surroundings. Always question IT checkups as they may not always be scheduled. Never hold doors open for other people that you aren't aware of that work in the firm.

Sincerely,

Steven
