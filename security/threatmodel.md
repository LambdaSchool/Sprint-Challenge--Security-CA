Good afternoon, Brian.

Today we became aware of a security threat to our systems. I wanted to take a moment to explain the situation to you, and the steps you must take to minimize the risk of being compromised. First, and foremost, as a member of the DNC(Democratic National Committee), there are many people, foreign and domestic who would seek to undermine our goals and seek to gain access to our data. Please take the time to review these notes and take precautions to prevent unwanted dissemination of of our data.

Attack surface: Home Computers, Phone/PDA(cell/landline), notebooks, files, offices 


Adversaries: Other Politcal parties, Foreign governments, Irate citizens, those whom don't share our political views, criminal organizations

Attack vectors: Phone taps, password cracks, email phishing, keyloggers, office break-ins, stealing laptops/phones, filing cabinets and briefcases

Mitigations: Everyone should have received a personal email account to be used through our secure email service. This account is not to be accessed from home devices. (ie. Work phone/pc for work only). Make sure to setup your 2-factor Authentication as outlined in our training kit. Our entire system is encrypted. Please follow these instructions to minimize the risk to the security of our systems.

Regards, 

The IT Guy.
