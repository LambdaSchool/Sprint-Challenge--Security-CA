                          Email Memorandum

Greetings all Staff,

As you know we are living in troubled times where our informaion is taken for granted is not safe. In our line of work in handling confidential information of patients, their test results, medication lists, demographics, etc., we have to think of way of protecting this information as our own. There are adversaries that will try to create an attack surface to get this information and possible sell the information on the black market or use the information as ransom. 

We use and rely on our software system for protection from the attackers/hackers to the best of our knowledge but we can do better in stepping up our protocol methods such as making sure we are creating randomized hashed passwords using the password generator manager that we recently implemented last month. This can create a secure passphrase that is encrypted to the highest level of security. Also we need to change our current passwords and login credentials.

Lastly, we need to keep our personal information protected as well by using the password generator so we won't be hacked ourselves and in our line of work we are targets as well. We must protect our information like we protect our patients. We need to log out of our terminal when we walk away from them and if we have to login at a station that is not our own, use the same methods of logging in and out as previously stated. Do not open emails with attachments without running a scan to see its threat potential. Do not show or give any sensitive information to any one unless authorized in writing. No verbal disclosures!

Lets keep our information secured!!

Sincerely,

Charletta Bullard
