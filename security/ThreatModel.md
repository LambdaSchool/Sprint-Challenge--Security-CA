One of the bigger security threats right now is phone number spoofing scams.
Software is used to fool caller IDs into displaying the wrong caller information.
Anyone could call you claiming to be someone important, like the IRS or Microsoft.
This attack usually targets older non-tech savvy people, but it could potentially fool anyone.
Sometimes the calls come from clicking fraudelent advertisements and having the user's computer locked and being told to enter their phone number so that they can be called back with the fake number.
The calls can also just come out of the blue from scammers going down a list of phone numbers.
If you are not sure that the caller is who they say they are, it is advised to hang up, verify the real number of the agency, and call that number back.
Other signs of a fraudulent caller is being asked for sensitive information, being immediately pressured into doing something, or being asked to send money through prepaid cards.
