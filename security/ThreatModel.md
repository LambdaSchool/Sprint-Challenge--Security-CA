Hey there,

You know how today, we live in a society rife with security threats, so it's becoming
ever more important that we stay vigilant about our security. The largest threat for 
us these days would be our email and social media logins. 

Social media logins have become more prevalent because of how we use them to log in 
to other services. So if that were compromised, the attacker could potentially get 
access to a myriad of other services we use. Emails are similarly used as the password
reset mechanism for many services we use. The most compromising here would be our
bank account logins.

I'm personally using two factor on both my Facebook & Google authentications, which gives
me some peace of mind, but my plan is to eventually use a Yubikey for these particularly
vulnerable gateways. Yubikey is a layer of hardware authentication that becomes
difficult to mimic through an online attack (the attack would instead have to be a
physical one). 

With all the hacks of late, most of our passwords are out there, so we need to be vigilant
in other ways to protect ourselves.
