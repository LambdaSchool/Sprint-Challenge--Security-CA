John, our boss, treats computers in a similar fashion to appliances. He expects to be able to use them with minimal trouble and effort in order to get his job done. When there is an issue, he tends to focus on what will get him working again as quickly as possible, which can lead to a number of security problems. For one thing, the company IT policy requires that he change his password once a month, so to keep things simple, he leaves his current password on a sticky note attached to his monitor. Instead, he could carry a token that changes on a regular basis, either a piece of hardware or work software on his cellphone that can authenticate him.

John is also a very social person, and vulnerable to manipulation due to his reliance on the IT department for support. Someone could call him while impersonating one of the IT staff in order to gain access to his computer. Ideally, a system of verification would ensure that John could easily discern whether or not the person contacting him was actually working for the company. There are a number of ways this could be implemented, for example, using in-house software over direct cellular communication.

The persons that might seek to gain access to his account could include co-workers, criminals seeking access to his financial information, or even a spouse. To safeguard from the latter, a separation of work from personal systems is recommended, which in addition to having a work computer, could include a separate virtual environment on a personal phone with its own method of authentication.
