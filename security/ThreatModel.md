# Here is the 'Security Measures Outline' we discussed earlier:

- Step 1: We have to encrypt the laptops. We can't allow an information breach of any kind.
- Step 2: From this point forward, we will be using a mobile app for two-factor authentication. This will protect us from remote attackers.
- Step 3: From this point forward, Windows passwords will need to be changed every 30 days.
- Step 4: In regard to passwords, there will be no complexity requirements. However, as discussed, the password length will need to be a minimum of 15 characters. Encourage your employees to think of a short phrase they have memorized and use that as a password.
- Step 5: As always, do not allow anyone access inside the building, without proper credentials. If you notice anything or anyone suspicious, notify Security immediately.
- Step 6: Wifi passwords will change every 60 days. As a reminder, never give out your Wifi password to anyone, even fellow employees.

Any questions, let me know. Thanks, and may the force be with you.
