Dear (Insert Name Here),

    I am writing to you based on (insert project name here). As you may know I am part of the remote team also working on this project and with our projects not only recieving more traffic, but the company has also been recieving more clients daily which means we are more inclined to the things listed below.

###Attack Surfaces
When working remotely there are a couple huge areas of attack, the first one being
your personal devices/work devices. The second huge area of attack is public acess to WI-FI if you are working on the go.

###Adversaries
As I said previously with our project gaining more recognition and traffic we are becoming a hotspot for people looking to hack our accounts whether they be criminal
or people seeking anyway to make the company fail.

###Attack Vectors
The main way our work for the company and any personal information can be in threat is from hackers, since we are working remotely they may see us as a more vulnerable section compared to people in the company's corporate offices.

###Mitigations
I would highly recommend having a dedicated work set-up and having a seperate office/space/computer for others to use when in the household to refrain from any
company information being taken from anyone around you or close to you this will also help keep any hackers away because the internet won't be browsed so freely on the computer you are working from. As far as threats while you're working on the go, make sure you are closed out of any work accounts and working offline while producing any code and I suggest turning off any settings that could enable your devices to be discovered (i.e by other devices). The best way to prevent any hackers would be to make sure you're either using 2-factor authentication or using
a password manager of sorts and as i'm sure you know you should refrain from using
the same password for everything including work accounts.

I hope this information was helpful to you and if there are any follow up questions feel free to rreply to this email.
