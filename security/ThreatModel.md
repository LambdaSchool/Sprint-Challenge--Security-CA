# Michael Scott
## Regional Manager

### Background:
* Michael takes a little bit of knowledge and takes it to the extreme.  If he knows addition, he knows calculus.  The same thing applies to his knowledge of the tech world.  He can use his cell phone, so he thinks he can set up his own network security.
* Michael is immature and quick to revenge.  He is naive and can be easily manipulated.  While he makes few enemies, his naivety and ignorance is well known and people often take advantage.  

### Attack Surfaces
* Michael doesn't use his computer for much more than looking at cat videos and checking his e-mail.  He thinks that his old copy of McAfee that has never been updated protects him. *He turns off all Microsoft/anti-virus/etc updates*.  That being said, as he is the regional manager, his computer has access to sensitive information about his branch, as well as information related to those higher up the food chain.
* He still uses a flip phone, so while a phone call could still be compromising, there is not much else in the threat department there.

### Adversaries
* His main adversary is a salesman named Jim Halpert.  While he never does anything too dastardly, he is a constant threat to Michael in generally insignificant ways.
* While normally his right hand man, Dwight Schrute, when slighted, can be quite formidable.  His creativity and lack of intelligence are a deadly combination and can lead to dire circumstances when a prank goes wrong.
* An ex, Jan Levinson, who regularly falls for Michael, only to come to her senses, holds a soft spot in Michael's heart.  Not so much an adversary, but someone who could easily manipulate him, more so than the average person.
* Schizophrenic or creative, one of Michael's many personalities or alter egos could get out of hand and compromise the security of the office.

### Arrack Vectors
* As Michael's security software is not up to date, he is definitely vulnerable to key loggers, spyware, viruses, trojans, malware, etc.  As long as they act behind the scene and don't make themselves apparent, he'd be none the wiser. *If a pop up causes interruption to a video of a kitten stuck in a shoe, he will find a way to stop it from happening*.  
* Michael uses 'mscott' or 'michael' as his username and his password is always 'password' or 'ilovejan'.  One wouldn't need a password dictionary and a hacking tool like John the Ripper to bypass his login information.
* Social engineering is an obvious method to use as Michael has the mind of a child.  Spear Phishing with topics such as song parodies or hockey would be an easy in.  Pretending to be Billy Joel on the phone would get him to tell you anything.  Simply just pretending to be his friend, because he is so lonely, would go for miles.  Say "that's what she said" and you could gleam any information from him you wanted.

### Mitigations
* Provide Michael with updated anti-virus and anti-malware protection.  Have the patience to teach him about computer viruses and withstand multiple jokes about little men hiding in his computer or hoping his keyboard doesn't give him chlamydia.  Also provide counseling for the enduring paranoia he will most likely have that someone is watching him at all times.
* Get him a password manager and a legitimate VPN.  Again, have the patience to endure jokes about him talking to his password manager and his demands for a real private network.
* Not much can be done about his naivety.  The only way to help improve this factor would be to regularly test him with fake phone calls/emails until he begins to understand that Sting wouldn't be calling him to talk about Dunder Mifflin secrets or he won't get free hockey tickets for downloading a program on his work computer.
