Greetings! 

My name is Omoniyi Alimi and I am the developer working to secure your network and applications across your college campus. You made it clear in our last email that you were looking to investigate some breeches in security regarding student emails and passwords that were the targets of fishing and hacking. Below I have attached a Threat model to address the areas of concern discussed previously. 

[ATTACHMENT]
Although your security measures have proven to be affective there are some improvements to be made. I want to first outline the possible areas that can be affected. 
The academic portal you are using is exposed in various ways around campus. The computer network in every library and computer lab can be affected, as well as student cellphones and laptops that are connected to the network. The program used for students to access grades has been compromised by a group of hackers looking to improve grades. Although this was the attack that alerted my team, other advesaries may be students looking to decrease/increase financial services, hackers who are looking to prove their abilities, scorned faculty looking to get even, and other criminials looking to steal private information for fraud or ransom purposes (as seen with the pacemakers earlier this year). The common method in hacking this type of database is often password theft through anonymous users evading the authetification system. Also users getting onto the portal with an unsecured network could lead to possibly dangerous consquences. In addition survelliance of others is a possibility as some students, faculuty, or staff may look as others are logging into their portals, or save their passwords on their devices. In order to alleviate these pressures surrounding your security issues our team has completed a plan to prevent and protect from future issues. 

THREAT MODEL PLAN: 
-Increasing the amount of Authorization on each page of the system. 
-There can be role based authentification in order to decrease the liklihood of nonpatrons inflitrating the site. 
-Cookie management would also be a good way to manage security threats on the school campus portal. 
-In addition the use of cryptography could be vital in protecting your university from threats. 

Please let me know if you have any questions, or input in regards to the Threat Model Plan. We would love to hear your thoughts. 

Best,

Omoniyi Alimi
