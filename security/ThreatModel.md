### Threat Model

Subject: Security Threat

After looking at our newly rolled out app for our loan service, it seems that personal
user information is not getting stored properly. If I look at the code more closely, it 
turns out that client info and passwords are exposed when they should be hashed at the very least. 
Potential adversaries to this would be identify thiefs and quite frankly anyone looking to make a quick buck.
I advise that the app be shut down until we can identify the root cause for the issue and fix the problem so 
that user info is not continuing to be exposed.

Furthermore we need to reach out to all users and have them reset their passwords and usernames to mitigatre the risk. 
I would also recommend that we prompt user to install 2 factor authentication which further mitigates any
potential risks that may arise. Let me know how you feel about this plan of action and how we should process.
