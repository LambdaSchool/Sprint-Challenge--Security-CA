Thomas - 30 yrs old. Run of the mill plant worker. Your average Joe. Uses his smartphone on a daily basis to check email and play games. Some of those emails are his work emails. Has a PC at home to play games. Uses the same password for everything and does not use antivirus software.

Attack surface - phone, computer
Adversaries - phishers, scammers
Attack vectors - email phishing, password cracking, malware
Mitigations - Password manager and possibly 2-factor auth, antivirus software.

Good morning!

I want to talk about security, and a man named Thomas. Thomas is 30 years old. He is just your average joe. Works in a factory and doesn't do much but play video games on his PC at home. He has a smart phone that he uses to also play games and check personal and work email. Thomas doesn't really have a sense of security when it comes to technology because he doesn't care. He uses the same password for every account he has. Fortunately for him, he's a nice guy.

So, there's our man. He's not a big target but he's an easy one. I sure hope his phone doesn't get compromised. The person would have access to his work and personal email then. Also, phishing emails from someone he "knows" could be a problem. It doesn't seem like he would have a problem clicking on any link as long as the name was right. Thomas could have a malware problem with downloads because he plays games. Or, if his password got hacked or discovered, the person would have access to everything. This guy is vulnerable.

So, what can we do to help him? Have him set up a password manager would proabably be a good start. Then 2-factor authentication to have a little extra padding. Also, because he plays games I would definitely have him install some antivirus software.

These are my thoughts. Thanks!
