- Greetings Tim!

I know you are new the team here at BudgetLine, so I thought I would give you and update of where we are currently at with the security of our app.  In the next couple of months we will be rolling out not just updates, but completely new code and ditching our flash based application that is out of date.

BudgetLine, as you are aware, is one of the top three Budget Applications used by people who need an easy to access multi platform application to keep track of their purchases, expenses and general financial situation.

We will talking about user security from the perspective of Attack Surface, Adveraries, Attack Vectors, and things we can do to Mitigate threats.

1. Attack Surface:  

    * One thing that differentiates our software from the competition is our premium plan financial advising tools.  Not only do we take user input, but if a user chooses, we can import direct bank data to look at the most accurate picture possible.  From there a user can choose the basic algorithms for financial independence we have in place, or they can be assigned a premium advisor to confer with on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis.

    From this point of view our attack surface is the database which stores vast amounts of financial information about each user.  Since the new application will auto-update from the user's bank, the additional inclusion of direct bank and routing numbers adds a new dimension to just how much our user's trust us with their information.

    Because our app will be available on multiple platforms, we will need security that takes mobile devices into consideration, as well as the security of the various networks, public and private, the user may be loggin into while out and about.

2. Adversaries:  

    * Financial crime is an age old problem, and those that would seek to defraud and steal from others is same now as it always has been.  The major difference is the toolset of those that would compromise our financial security.  

    There are no shortage of individuals who would wish to steal the information in our databases, and we must be constantly vigilant.

    Further, with the new rollout we expect more customers to sign on with our program, and we have increased the amount of accountants and financial advisors we have on hand for our consumers.   Though our background check and interview process is stellar, it is still possible that threats could originate from inside our company.  

3. Attack Vectors:

    * Password theft remains a major problem for our users that haven't yet learned not to make overly simple passwords, or simply use the same passwords for all of their devices.   

    Further, the way in which we manage our files within the database needs to be secure and properly encrypted.   

    Finally, with so much coordination between various banks and our app, bank passwords and app passwords need to be clearly different, and the process of communication between our insitutions heavily encrypted.

4. Mitigations:

    * Education is the number one way we plan to focus on mitigating the problem from the user end.  We already have general financial security as part of our series of intro videos when a user signs up.  We will be adding information to these videos to teach the user how to create strong passwords and differenciate them over multiple devices. 

    * On our side we will make sure we have the extremely complex encryption protocols that will be followed strictly at all levels of the code writing and review process.  

    * Further, all our servers will remain in-house, and we will not outsource this to a different company.  This will allow us more direct control over the information on each server, and the logic of how these servers are named, protected, and generally made invisible to most threats.

We look forward to having you on our team as a junior dev in these exciting months to come.
