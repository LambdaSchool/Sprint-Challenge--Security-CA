Threat model:
    Clark, a newspaper reporter from The Daily Planet, writes his news column on encrypted company software. His on again of again girlfriend Lois sits next to him and always competes with Clark to "break" a story first. In the past, she has flirted with co-workers, constantly looked over his shoulder, and even hacked into his computer a couple of times. 
    
    Though for different reasons his friend Lex, a super genius billionaire, has also hacked into Clark's computer a couple of times. Lex believes 
    Clark has a secret and he won't rest until he finds out what it is. Jimmy, The Planet's photographer, knows Clark's secret. Thier is another billionaire, Bruce, who is particularly interested in Clark's activities.

Attack surface:
    The different points of his software environment where he can be invaded. 
   
Adversaries:
    Lois, Lex, Bruce, Jimmy.

Attack vectors:
     Clark's input fields, protocols, and interfaces.

Mitigations:

    To reduce the risk of attack Clark must visualize all potentially vulnerable points. Luckily he has exceptional vision. He should use 2-factor authentication and encrypt everything.
