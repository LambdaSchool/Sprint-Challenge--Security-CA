Hi June, 

Welcome to our team. I'm very pleased to have you join our company. 

Like you, I used to work for a small startup company. When I came back to corporate world, I was so frustrated because we have many steps and processes to get the data for analyzing. 

We're facing many security threats more than you imagine. We're dealing millions of dollars transactions every minute. We store important health information of our customers. Potential adversaries would be criminals intent on stealing this money and information. One of the potential problems would be password theft. 

We, data science team, have passwords to access the customer data. Writing a password on a sticky note or storing this data in an unencrypted file can be risky even though PI(personal information) wore de-identified. We address this issue by providing a separate security token. A security token provides a double security even if it is a little annoying.

There are many different processes like this token generator to get the data in this company. Sometimes you need approvals from many different managers. I hope you adapt to a new work environment quickly.

Thanks, 
Elly
