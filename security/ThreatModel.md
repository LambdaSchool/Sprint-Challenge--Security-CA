Scenario: 

Co worker's (Cardi B) Client wants to protect his/her cryptocurrency investments

Cardi B,

I reviewed John McAfee's situation, and these are my thoughts and suggestions as follows:

Adversaries:

1. Hackers
2. Other Criminals

Attack Vectors: 

1. Phishing
2. Theft/Robbery
3. Social Engineering
4. Brute Force
5. Key Logging

Stay alert, be aware of who you reveal ANY information to.

Attack Surface:

1. Exchanges - IDEX, GDAX and Binance 
2. CPU

Always make sure you're at the right address, bookmark sites and check if there is a star there when you're at that page, to take a step further, download an extension (Cryptonite) for your browser that adds an extra layer of security (Extended Validation Certificate).
If the exchange's security is debatable, I would stay away. In general, read reviews and decide for yourself.

Mitigations:

1. 2fa (Google Auth, Authy)
2. Hardware/Cold Wallets (Ledger, Trezor, or Paper)
3. Strong Passwords (LastPass)
4. Metamask
5. Extensions (Cryptonite)

I recommend Ledger Nano S to keep your coins safe. Use strong and different passwords for different sites, LastPass is a great password management extension, Google Passwords is also better and more secure of recent. 

Stay vigilant.


Best,
