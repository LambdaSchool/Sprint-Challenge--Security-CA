# Threat Model Overview

A threat model is a tool to expose potential weaknesses in security, identify attackers who may attempt to breach security, address their techniques, and offer solutions to better protect your security.

## Attack Surface

The attack surface is anywhere an attacker can compromise your security. From the technology we use to the places we go, there are many opportunities for attackers to find weak points in our security integrity as well as any technology's security integrity. For instance, using public wi-fi without proper protection (e.g. VPN) or using a technology that is not secured well leaves you open to attack and possibly have your valuable data stolen. Even trusted sources are susceptible to attacks. Remember Target and Equifax?

## Adversaries

Simply, adversaries are people who want to attack your security. They could be people you know such as disgruntled coworkers, family, or friends who want to hurt you or your reputation. They can be people you don't know such as an identity thief or a hacker. Depending on your line of work, adversaries can be companies or nations! Knowing who might want to hurt you is important to tailoring what steps you need to take to protect yourself. A lifestyle blogger doesn't need the security of Edward Snowden, right?

## Attack Vectors

Attack vectors are specific points in the attack surface where an attacker may strike. It is specifically how they can attack you. Do you use the same password for every application? How easy is it for them to call 'Company X' pretending to be you and ask for your personal information? Do you care about the difference between http and https? If someone were to steal your wallet or phone, how easy would it be to get your bank card pin number or passwords?

## Mitigation

Mitigation is the steps you can take to minimize security threats based on your attack surface, adversaries, and attack vectors. Keeping the attack surface as small as possible is one way to help reduce threats. Learning about the security aspects of the technology you use is also important. For instance, using the wi-fi example above, you could buy a VPN for when you need to use public wi-fi or use your phone as a hotspot. Many applications offer additional security services such as 2-factor authentication, and you should take advantage of that service!

## Summary

What technologies do you use in your home, at work, and in public? Who might want your personal information or the data in your hands? How secure are the technologies you use? How secure is the data in your life? What are some ways the technology you use can be abused? What security steps have you or the technology you use taken to mitigate threats?
