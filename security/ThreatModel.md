Subject: Security Threat

Regarding recent studies, I have found that there are some potentially concerning security flaws. With the recent Facebook issues, this only brings more harm to social media. It appears that client passwords are stored as plain text. While the solution may have seemed good at the time of creation, it is very poor practice to do so in this age of technology. Potential adversaries of politicians or other important personel that use the site can easily be hacked in to. While it is generally understood to NOT share certain personal information on social media, most users could potentially be using the same password for our site along with their email address listed. If that information gets in to the wrong hands, users could become victim to fraud or other issues.

Please seek a solution to enable hashed passwords and require all users to update their passwords upon logging in as soon as the update is pushed. I also recommend letting users know of the security threat in order to keep open relations with the public to allow them to understand the severity of such a threat. We should also highly encourage users to use our two factor authentication for added security to deter further potential security risks. Encourage them to update passwords for other outside sources they use as well.
