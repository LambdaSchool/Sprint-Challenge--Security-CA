# Everyday Average User Threat Model

## Understand the Threats, Adversaries, Attack Vectors, and Mitigations for everyday computer user

#### Everday users worldwide are at a high risk of vulnerability attacks by anyone malcious individual that may want to 1) steal personal information 2) gain access to systems that the indiviual may have access to 3) use their system as a way of spreading malicous code or using it for distribution point of botnet or other related attacks.

## Attack Surface

#### No system is perfect, and at the heart of every computer is an Operating System. It seems every other day you hear of an update to fix a vulnerability that someone managed to either a) just happen to find through testing or circumstance , or b) information that was compromised due to said "hole" in the system. There are certain networks that are harder to gain access to in the first place, but as commonplace as wi-fi, cell phones, and malicious software that is downloaded, often the networks are becoming less safe.

* Public Networks
* Cell Phones
* Home Networks
* Malicious Software/Viruses
* Humans

## Adversaries

#### There is a wide range of "characters" who may want to compromise a system. Criminals may want to gather information on credit card numbers, shopping or browser history for the use of spam and advertisements, access to another network like VPN of work networks, or to steal a person's identity. There are also people out there they may mean no harm, but do it just to see if it can be done. They may still mess with your system as a prank, but this can be frustrating nonetheless.

#### Their may also be those people who don't to directly gain your information, or do harm to you, but rather use your resources as a coordinated attack against other systems. While this may not directly effect you, or your accounts, it can hog the resources of your system, bringing your production to a halt.

## Attack Vectors

#### There are numerous ways that a person can try and gain access to your system(s). These can include, but are not limited to, gathering packets from an unprotected public wi-fi, using brute force/dictionary attack program to guess passwords, send viruses or trojan horses that get access via a backdoor, or even through another person that may know or easily guess your information.

#### There can even be instances where a person just happens to walk by and glance at your screen and see just enough to know how to get in. Also writing down passwords and storing them on the back of a computer, or in a desk drawer, can also allow people to capture your passwords.

#### Phishing, or using fake websites is also another way that a user can be fooled. Making a website that looks identical to your bank and asking to confirm password is quite deceptive. This attack usually comes in the form of an email, or redirecting a user to another website.

## Mitigations

#### Although the risks are out there, and many openings to attack, with proper security you can protect yourself. A few of these include using a 2-factor authentication from your bank or other places that store currency or delicate information. By having a 2nd form of authentication, such as sending a text to your phone, it helps in making sure that 1) the site or program is really from them 2) you are who you say you are.

#### As a precaution you should also never share information or visit sites that have valuable information on a public network. Many networks in the public domain will have a warning to do as stated: You never know what information is being grabbed from the air in the form of packets when you do so. There are programs that protect against this, and by using encryption you can help to maintain a protection of said data that is being transferred, although always remember that even encryptions can be broken.
