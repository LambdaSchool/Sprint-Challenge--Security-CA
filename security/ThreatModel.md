**Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model**

*Think of a threat model* : Build a mobile application which is secure to our customers.

_Main attack surface_ for this application would be mobile. Customers carry it wherever they go. Not sure all of them protect their phones with a password or fingerprint. 
 
_Adversaries_ could be anyone in family or criminals.

_Attack vectors_ may be losing unsecured mobile, spying data, intruders through free wifi.

_Mitigations_Customer data should be protected by atleast 2 way authentication.

Basically we are working on the following criteria:
1. What are we working on?
1. What could go wrong?
1. What are we going to do about it?
1. Have we done a good job?
