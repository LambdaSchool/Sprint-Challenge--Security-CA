#Threat Model:

Daniel is an Esports professional. He's part of a well-established team in the industry, and currently plays League of Legends, the most popular game in the world, at the highest level. He operates his own public-facing accounts on Twitter, Snapchat, Twitch, and YouTube, and reaches millions of followers across all platforms. He also freelances as a coach for individual players that want to get better on the side for additional income and opportunities for content-creation. Because of this, he manages invoices and separate non-personal email accounts. Only he knows his passwords for his public-facing accounts, and his Team Manager has his password for his business-related (usually used for sponsorships, event bookings, and/or endorsements) email.

#Attack Surfaces:

Daniel, like most other people on the internet, would be vulnerable to any malicious users figuring out his password and gaining access to private/personal/sensitive information available in DMs, as well as those attackers having the ability to post embarrassing content to millions of users across all platforms.

#Adversaries:

Usually, I'd say the people most interested in compromising private information are drama-related content creators (think keemstar and similar) or the user's own fans. Occasionally in the past, users with a big following like this have been attacked by collectives with a message to spread to a certain demographic very quickly (like LulzSec in 2011)

#Attack Vectors:

Password theft or cracking is probably the biggest problem, but also since esports professionals tend to live in a house with their teammates, visitors and other teammates could physically access their accounts on their computers while they're logged in as well.

#Mitigations:

Using a password manager with auto-generated passwords could help. Additionally, ensuring they log out of their machines and keep those secure. 2FA can be a big help too, since it's rare that people don't have their phones with them in 2018.
