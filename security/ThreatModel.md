Hi Coworker,

Twitter recently found a bug in their codebase that stored all user passwords, openly in plain text.

Also, in the event that you have used the same password(s) on different platforms, change them as well. Now is a great time to start using a password manager (i.e. <code>Dashlane, 1Password, or LastPass</code>) and <code>two-factor authentication</code> methods.
