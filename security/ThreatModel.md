## Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

To whom it may concern:

I am writing to you as a concerned coworker and friend. I have noticed that your personal security preferences and situation possesses much room for improvement. Your attack surface is quite large and results in many potential attack points. 

For example: you use a multitude of online services to store personal data, you have many devices that are connected to the internet, you also keep hard copies of certain files and data in your office. 

While you might trust most of the people that you come into contact with, there will always be adversaries out there who are after something that you have. As employees of a well-known company, I would not rule out competing companies to try and gain access to your personal and work data. I also know that you enjoy trolling people on the internet so if you're not careful, someone might take your trolling seriously some day and attempt to attack you. In addition, there's always the chance that you're invovled in a more general attack in which they aren't specifically targetting you as a person, but simply because someone wants your credit card and banking information, install ransomware on your computer, etc.

After examining your habits, I have determined that you are very susceptible to attacks. You constantly leave your laptop and phone unattended with no password or passcodes. Your passwords are very basic and easily crackable, and you use the same one for everything. You never shred important documents. You don't even have a password on your home network. Any determined attacker can easily compromise your information and data.

However, I did not write you this email just to insult your security precautions (or lack thereof). I can help mitigate these errors! First of all, put a password and passcode on your phone and laptop. Stop leaving them out in the open unattended. Buy a shredder so no one can just go through your trash and find important information. Change your online passwords to something much more difficult to guess. If you need, use a password manager. Stop storing so much information online because if any of those services get compromised, you are screwed! Sign up for 2-factor auth wherever possible. Encrypt your files. Be more careful with who you interact and exchange information with. Set up your home network password.

Just performing those basic tasks will improve your security exponentially! You're welcome.
