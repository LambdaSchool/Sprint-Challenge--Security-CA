# Personal Threat Model

You may not know it, but your online security is at risk. Sound alarming? Well that's because we usually think of risk as binary. Risk assessment, however, is always on a spectrum. The typical user (i.e. everyone) uses information systems for storing sensitive data. That means everything from passwords to credit card information to photos that they don't wish to share.

To understand your own security risk, it's important to break things down into the standard professional security lingo. The following are the major considerations.

Attack surface - The overall vulnerability landscape, which contains services that you use and any compromisable systems for storing and using information.
Attack vector - A point of leverage wherein an attack can be waged.
Adversaries - Sounds dire, but it's really anyone who has means and motive to potentially attack.
Mitigations - The steps you can take to fortify yourself.

Okay, now that we have that out of the way, how might they apply to you? Here are some examples.

Adversaries - Business competitors are an obvious one, but more likely is someone who already uses these attacks elsewhere and has decided based on general information about you (your occupation, your use of a service, etc.) that you are a good target. The key consideration is your *value* to the target. Additionally, people tend to choose targets that are easy or obvious to them. Understanding the value that your information could have, as well as any obvious vulnerabilities (like passwords stored in open site at work) helps to visualize this field of adversaries.

Attack surface - People count on all sorts of services - cloud storage, email accounts, text messaging, "protected" Wi-Fi, and even the password-protected login to their workstation - to provide a sense of security that isn't always so secure. Any of these services carries some risk of attack.

Attack vectors - The services mentioned above have several potential vulnerabilites. Some of them are technical, such as with bugs like WannaCry or exploits like buffer overflows and code injection. However, as an end user who has already chosen a secure service, you are most often vulnerable in some very predictable places. Receiving an email or even a text message from the someone pretending to be the service provider is a massive vulnerability. Failure to backup online or even local data storage is another. 

Mitigations - We'll be quick. Don't write your passwords down. Ever. Get a password vault like LastPass, and follow its recommended security strategies. Protect it with a strong passPHRASE that you can easily remember. Change passwords at least every two months. That includes your Wi-Fi password. Use WPA2 and turn off the WPS pin (an attacker can crack that pin in minutes). And if you get an email from a service provider, manually go to the providers page instead of clicking the link from the email. Always check the url. Always update your operating system and any software that you use.
