# Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model 

Jean is a twenty-five year old first grade teacher. She teaches first grade in an elementary school and has a total of 25 students. She has to log in to her school computer daily to take attendance, add grades, and check her school email. She also uses the internet to go on child friendly websites to use them for teaching purposes. 

Attack surface: Jean uses the computer on a daily basis, using the school website to enter student attendance, add grades, and check emails from the school and parents. Everytime she enters the system she is opening up students personal information e.g. address, parents names, phone numbers, emergency contacts.

Adversaries: A hacker or someone that wants access to the school computers can access this information is they are able to sign in with Jean's password. It can happen if she is not careful or if she uses a weak/easy password. Also they can access her school email. If Jean uses the school computer to check her personal email, they can probably get access to her personal information as well.

Attack vectors: When Jean opens up her personal email and opens up any attachments she is putting personal information, as well as the school sites information at risk to be get a virus or to get hacked. Also the emails that are getting emailed to her school email address are coming from all different emails, e.g. gmail, yahoo, etc. Her school email is public on the school site. Meaning anyone that wants to email her, so they can get into her email and hacker her information can do so. Once the email is sent and opened the hacker can take it from there. 

Mitigations: Jean should enter a strong password that only she knows, and be cautious when opening up emails from parents. She should also only use it for school purposes and check her personal email on her own personal devices versus the school computer. Along with going on child friendly sites for school purposes, and leave the web surfing for home.
