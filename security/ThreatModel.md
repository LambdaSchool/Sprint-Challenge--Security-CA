## Part 1 ThreatModel

David is a 29 year old lawyer for a large international firm specialzing in patent disputes. He takes care to keep his work and personal life seperate, even going to the length of working under a psuedonym. However recently he has been involved on more famous cases and his face ended up in the news.  

He uses an iPhone with an alphanumeric 10 character password to avoid any attempts at bruteforcing his device and takes meticlous care to only conduct business communications over end to end encrypted messaging services.

The main attack surface his adversaries have to target him is the fact that his face is now well known to anybody who wants to find him. Because of the care that David goes to ensure that his computer devices aren't compromised, it will most likely be easier to physically target him in person. He can be setup and blackmailed rather easily, or even physically threatened by masked criminals. 

His main adversaries are competing law firms that may find very useful information for the cases they are working on to defend their clients. The corporations that hold the patents David is involved in arbitrating disputes with also hold a keen interest in finding what information David has.

Some mitigations that David can use to prevent himself from being compromised might be to hire a personal security force if the threat level is high enough. This will help in case he is physically targeted. He can also reduce the amount of information that he holds at one moment, perhaps even setting files to self destruct after a certain time limit. This is difficult in a field where documentation is key but can be accomplished by storing the files that will be selfdestructed in an quantum encrypted safe.
