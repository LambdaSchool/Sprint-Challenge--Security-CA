# Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

Consider a customer service call center worker for a major tech company. This is someone with access to a fair bit of sensitive customer data, possibly even financial information (if a customer needs to contact in order to update a method of payment, for example), and likely access to some insider information regarding the company they work for.

- **Attack Surface:** Modern customer service will typically require access to a computer and the Internet, and access to systems used by the company in order to store and retrieve customer information.
- **Adversaries:** The biggest adversaries are phone scammers/phishers, who will contact under the guise of regular customers, coworkers, or company management, and attempt to use social engineering techniques in order to either obtain sensitive information over the phone, or get the agent to navigate online to a compromising site.
- **Attack Vectors:** If the software used by service agents to access company-held customer data are exposed to the larger Internet (as in, not limited to a local network or VPN), then password theft and cracking are a threat. Unsecured traditional phone lines can also be problematic, as these can be eavesdropped with relative simplicity. Simple social engineering, however, is the main attack vector here.
- **Mitigations:** Two-factor authentication, especially from a physical key (Yubico, for example), as a requirement for logging into company systems is a must. Phone communication would be best handled digitally, rather than through traditional phone lines, as it is easier to keep a data line secure from eavesdroppers. It is also worthwhile to limit access to any sites not directly affiliated with the company, particularly social media sites. On the larger scale, data encryption for communication between the center and the main company is a must, and VPN's help prevent access to internal systems. Additionally, simple training for agents to not provide personal information to callers should be standard.
