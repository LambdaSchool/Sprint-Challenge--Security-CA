Dear John,

I am concerned about some of the security procedures and measures that are currently in use at our workplace.

I would like to state that our system has a lot of important and valuable information, so it is of vital importance that the security measures are changed to protect us in the future. One thing I would like to suggest is to have users log in with a PIN (second password) generated and sent to their work phones. This will prevent a breach of our worker accounts if someone was using a username/password that they use on their home computers.

I would also like to suggest that the workers do not use their real names for their login information. This way, if our company was a target of an attack, they would not know which account belonged to any specific employee.

Thank you
