# Threat Assessment for a Public Figure

## Adversaries

As a motivational speaker, Person X is likely to draw the interest of:
  - Jealous onlookers interested in financial profit
  - Disgruntled clients wishing to blame Person X for their troubles
  - Those with negative minds who wish to see good men fail and want to stir up trouble

## Attack Surface

Person X is exposed by the people who may try to enter his organization to get private information regarding him, becoming a personal student who gains access to privileged information. He is also exposed through his Wordpress website which uses a simple Admin login name and an easily-guessed password.

## Attack Vectors

It would be be fairly easy for a skilled thief to get into his website.

## Mitigations

Encryption is handled by Wordpress, but his password should be changed periodically and set using a system like BitWarden. He should make sure to take personal care of all of his security, keeping the information privately stored and handled by himself rather than a proxy. Because his public information could be easily accessed, all security questions should be obfuscated with easily-remembered but untrue answers. As should be standard, he should also implement two-factor auth. Finally, he should also be careful as to who he invites into his social group, beind sure to create a clear distinction between work and leisure.
