To All Employees,

In an effort to combat cyber attacks, the security team at Pied Piper would like to highlight
a few potential attacks to be aware of and precautions to take to prevent them. Our company
handles highly sensitive and confidential customer data and just one attack could erode trust in our services.

Our greatest vunerabilities (attack surface) are our internal login entry points and admin interfaces. Though we have layers of security in place beyond the intial employee login, an attacker with stolen credentials could still obtain data and reak havoc on our system. Our adversaries may include anyone from everyday blackhat basement hackers to more sophistated large scale operations seeking to sell or leak customer data for financial gain.

It is imperative to take the utmost measures as an employee here to prevent your credentials or your system from being compromised. Here are some preventive measures we are taking at Piedpiper in order to mitigate these risks:

#### 1. Login

- All passphrases must be a minimum of 20 characters long with a combination of upper/lower case, numbers and symbols. We ask that you do no use this passphrase anywhere else and you keep it very secure.

- We will start using Two Factor Auth effective tomorrow that will use the app Authy on your work-issued phones.

#### 2. Think Before You Click

- Do not click on any links or open attachments that you do not recognize. If you are unsure, please contact the security team immediately.

Pied Piper is particularly vulernable to phishing and ransomware attacks, and we are currently on high alert as you may have heard yesterday that our competitors Hooli were victims of an elaborate and highly sophiscated attack.

We thank you for your hard work and assistance in our efforts to enhance our company's cyber defenses.

Please reach out to me personally if you have any questions.

### Jeremy A. Jones
