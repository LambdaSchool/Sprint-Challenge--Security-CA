Bob,

Something has recently come to my attention that has me concerned. A recent report suggested that the actual demographic that most uses our services are a much older and less tech savvy group than we initially suspected. In some respects, this is great! We love the customers. But we observed some strange network behavior last week. I suspect someone had used one of our customer's login credentials to try to access our database. I think it may be wise to send out a general security guide to all of our customers to identify their potential risks and give them tips on how to mitigate them in order to protect both ourselves and our customer base. I have outlined the risks and potential resolutions below:

One of the main issues with our customer base is computer literacy. Frequently these are the customers that reuse passwords, or are easily socially manipulated into giving their information away through phishing attacks. They also do not have a well developed intuition about what sites are secure and what pose a threat. They are also less likely to use a robust anti-virus or malware detector. They are the most likely targets of online scammers and identity thieves.

In our guide e-mail we should include the following suggestions:

1.  Use a password manager for all sites so that you have a distinct password for every service and cross site attacks are less likely.
2.  Install a robust and well-trusted anti-virus program that not only prevents viruses, but informs you when you are trying to access a dangerous site.
3.  Be suspicious of any e-mail that appears legitimate but is asking for personal information. Check the origin of the e-mail, and if necessary, call the purported service (bank, government agency, company) at their publically posted number to verify the request is accurate and give them the desired information.
4.  Never send money or financial information to someone you don't know that is requesting it via e-mail. Especially not Nigerian Princes. If something seems suspicious, search the general text/request online to see if other people have reported it as a scam.
