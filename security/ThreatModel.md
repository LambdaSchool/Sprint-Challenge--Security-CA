## Threat Model


I am an awful offender of many of the pitfalls that plague the average user. A couple of years ago I got really tired of managing my passwords and just created a master password that I use for everything. Understanding the threats that are out there, I will use this assignment to fix that. 

The first step is to download a password manager. The next, I changed the passwords for all my accounts. Started with e-mail and then to bank accounts followed by services I use such as Amazon and credit karma. 

I already have linux on my system and while I think command line and SSH protocols are generally safer because most cyber criminals don't know or use these technologies, I still don't feel at the level I'm currently at that these steps are practical for what I do. As far as securing and password protecting my git commits. That is something that I found actually gets in the way. GitHub recently updated their software to do this but I went around it by downloading git credential manager for windows and that I suppose keeps my commits secure without me having to do anything after the initial setup. 

The Sandbox computer security program looks pretty cool and definitely something I will most probably be utilizing in the future when I feel that security might be a concern. It's probably really bad but I don't really worry about that. Over the last couple of years and the more I learned about cyber security, the more I've worked to minizing my internet presence. I don't really use social media or post any personal information to the Internet. I imagine with my endeavours into the programming world this will change and bring with it a need to employ more security measures but for now, I think the password manager is enough.
