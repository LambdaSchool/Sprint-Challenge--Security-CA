## RE: Potential Security Liability - Bello Briggs?

Subject Profile:

Bello Briggs is a junior developer at a small software engineering startup called StoreIT (a competitor with DropBox). Bello knows that security is important, but just has not gotten around to implementing any of the best practices he has learned about at StoreIT. Bello has one password memorized which he uses for everything (e.g. Amazon, Netflix, Banking, and his DropBox account). It is a very good password, long with many different On occasion he forgets this password, so he has written it on the inner lining of his favorite baseball hat, which he devoutly keeps within arms reach. Bello is an introvert, but manages cordial relationships with his co-workers, even on occasion going to and hosting game nights with other coworkers. Bello is good about locking his door before he leaves his office, but keeps a spare key in the Aloe plant outside his door in case of emergencies.

- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
  - Since his password is the same for all his online profiles, this would include literally all the systems he is a part of, as well as game nights with coworkers (where his hat is liable to be seen), and the Aloe plant itself (located directly outside his office).
- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
  - StoreIT: Anyone with access to his password at his own company.
  - DropBox: Anyone in security management at Drop Box wanting to infiltrate his company.
  - Possibly employees with malcious intent
  - Anyone who discovers intentionally or unintentionally, the location of Bello's master password (in his baseball cap) or the spare key to his office (in the Aloe plant).
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
  - Surveillance footage of Bello arriving at his office, realizing he doesn't have his key, and then using the key he keeps in the Aloe plant outside his office.
  - Brute force password cracking is unlikely to be an issue as Bello's password is strong; however, as he keeps the same password for all his subscriptions, including Drop Box, Bello's data could be compromised by anyone with access to Bello's password at Dropbox's security management, who could easily then access all of Bello's other online subscriptions.
  - Password theft is also likely, given that Bello's password is written on his baseball cap.
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)
  - It is recommended that Bello remove his spare key from the Aloe plant outside his office, in spite of the possiblity of an embarressing situation in the future, for the sake of the companies security and keeping his job. It is also recommended that he remove the password he has written in his baseball cap, and setup a finger print accessible password manager if he cannot realistically remember his passwords.
