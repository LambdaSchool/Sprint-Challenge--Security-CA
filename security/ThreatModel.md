User: Bob
Role: Software Engineer
Company: Medium-size fin-tech startup in a large city which is located an hour from his home.
Info: Bob works remotely 4 days of the week out of a coffee shop and then goes into the office on Friday. He works on his Macbook which he carries with him everywhere. He uses a password manager and has a home safe in which he keeps important passwords. He frequently travels since he works remotely.

### Attack surface:
Since Bob works remotely in a coffee shop he needs to be careful of the internet connection he is using. Traveling often with his vital laptop puts him at risk for physical theft. The services he uses online such as GitHub and hosting websites are another point of weakness.
  

### Adversaries:
Since Bob works with very sensitive data (financial accounts) he is a high value target. Criminals looking for financial gain would be the largest adversary. A secondary adversary could be competiting services who may wish to sabotage the company since he works in a very competitive sector.


### Attack vectors:
  - Physical theft of his laptop or passwords.
  - Phishing attempts
  - Virus/Worm/Trojan introduced by a thumb drive or infected file
  - Brute forcing weak passwords
  - Man-in-the-middle attack from weak internet

### Mitigations:
  - Physical tracking device on laptop and a locking device
  - Wariness of web activity
  - Using secure mobile hotspot
  - Passphrases and 2FA to secure his accounts
  - Using a VPN
