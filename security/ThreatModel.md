Hi coworker,

I'm writing you today to address some of the concerns with regrads to computer security.

I want to introduce you to the following terms and want you to always keep them in mind whenever you're using a computer or any electronic device:

- Attack surface
- Adversaries
- Attack vectors
- Mitigations

Attack surface is all the electronic devices that you use - personal computer, laptop, smartphone, smart TV, etc. You get the picture. Through all of these device you potentially can be targeted and your information can be comprimised.

Adversaries. These are people, computer bots (e.g. robots) that might target your electronic devices to steal your information.

Attack vectors are how the attackers (people or bots) can gain access to your devices.

Mitigation. This one is very important! Make sure that you use long passphrases, 2-factor authentication, encryption, pin-codes on mobile phones, etc.

This is a lot to process for one email. Sorry, but it's very important.

Please, feel free to ask me any question you might have.

Thanks,
Sergey
