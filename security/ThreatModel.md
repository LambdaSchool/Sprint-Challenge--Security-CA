Hi Jeff,

I've been doing an informal security assessment of the office and I've noticed a few things that I wanted to bring to your attention. Right now we don't have a security policy in place for our computers or work phones, which has resulted in many of them not being locked when not in use. I know we're not a big company, but we're planning to grow and with growth comes increased threat and risk. Not implementing security now will lead to increased problems down the road.

By allowing employees to handle (or not handle) their own security, we are potentially exposing confidential information to anyone that wants it. We frequently have visitors in the office and allow them to use computers on the intranet without restriction, which further exacerbates the risk. Any one of these visitors could steal information or plant malware or a virus, plus the unprotected laptops and phones that go home with employees at night can be accessed by anyone that has access to the device.

We need to protect these devices from accidental threats, such as someone who shouldn't be using the device accidentally modifying, deleting, or sharing company info. We also need to protect against intentional threats, such as competitors or those that just want to hack us and steal info or ransom it.

I suggest we start by developing a security policy and implementing it on every company laptop, desktop, phone, or other device as well as any personal devices that have access to the network. Locking of devices when not in use with strong passwords must be standard, preferably with two-factor authentication. We also need to secure all servers, routers, and other equipment and make sure they are all patched and up to date.

Thanks for your time. I'd be glad to speak with you further about this and help in any way I can.

Perry
