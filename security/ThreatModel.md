# Dear Friend

As of late cyber crime has been rapidly growing. With the recent exposure to hacking via shows like Mr. Robot and Arrow where they show a character hacking some network to defeat a bad guy, now seems like the right time to go over some simple yet productive ways for securing yourself and your network while you work. Please see the below information and if you have any questions please reach out to me.

Also if you can think of anything else to add to this please do so in a follow up email.

# Attack Vectors

An Attack Vector is a particular path within a computer or network that those with mallicous intent can use to spread harmful software. The Vector can be in the form of a virus, an opened email attachment, a pop-up page, or many other shady areas of the internet. I implore you to install an extension, such as AdBlocker, which will enact a pop-up blocker while you browse the web.

# Attack Surfaces

An attack surface is simply an entry point for a vector to deal damage to the system. Best practices dictate that you should keep the attack surface of your software in development to a minmal.

# Mitigations

Some these risks can be mitigated by using simple technologies as 2 form authentication when logging in to accounts, adding a password manager such as KeyChains on the Mac, or by securing sites such as BitBucket and GitHub with an SSH access key.

I hope that the above information helps a great deal and leads to a safe, fun, and productive time.

Best of Luck

Jonathan
