Coworker Bob,

Wtf were you thinking last night?? You forgot your laptop at the bar.
Yes, I have it. I know you're reading this email on your phone.
No, I won't tell anyone.

But... I did have fun peeping into it this morning.

Hey don't look at me like that! That's what you get for binge drinking on a Thursday.

In fact, you're lucky it was ME who found it, and not some 20-something hacker-wannabe.

Why? Because I found *a ton* of places where you could be compromised (these are called attack
surfaces Bob, bet you didn't know that).

To protect you, here's a small list of mitigations:

1. Don't use '1234' as a laptop password.

2. Once we find a better password for your Mac, activate Filevault. That way all your data will be encrypted, and no one will be able to get it without your password.

3. For the love of God Bob, don't have a bookmark folder called 'sexy time' on your work laptop. Use the Tor Browser for that type of... content.

4. Did you seriously use '1234' as a password for your email too??? Ok a) change that and b) set two-factor authentication (I'll teach you how).

That'll be it for now Bob. 

I'll keep trying trying to think of other attack vectors.

Until then, get your isht together Bob.

See you on Monday,

Richard
