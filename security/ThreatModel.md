Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

Dear coworker,
   
As you are well aware from the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, our digital
security and as we use more and more social media and allow these companies to have
unfeathered access to our personal and private information we increasingly put ourselves
at risk of being victimized by hackers and their cyber attacks. Because of all of these 
reasons, I think I should share with you of some security tips I remember learning in my class
at Lambda School because they can hopefully help you secure your personal data and be a reminder
to me to do the same.

Attack Vectors

Attack Vectors are paths or means by which a hacker can gain access to your computer or network server
either at your house or at work to exploit system vulnerablities to deliver any of the following either
individually or together viruses, email attachments, Web pages, pop up windows, Instant messages, trojan 
horses, worms, spyware which all fall under Phishing, SQL Injection or DDOS attacks. My suggestions when you 
launch your web browser application to install the following extensions: Adblock Plus, AdBlock if you use Chrome, 
NoScript is an extension for Firefox that protects against cross-site scripting attacks(XSS), cross-zone DNS 
rebinding/CSRF attacks (router hacking) and Clickjacking attempts but it only allows JavaScript, Flash, Java 
and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice. For further protection against attack
vectors, I strongly suggest using the search engine DuckDuckGo rather than Google because it does not track your
search history or Tor Browser.
