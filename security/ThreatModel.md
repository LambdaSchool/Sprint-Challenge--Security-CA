# Threat Model - Freelance Full-Stack Client

{this.name},

As discussed in the previous email, I have finished deploying and connecting your website along with the included infrastructure. Though you did choose {this.company} as your host, it's always best to have more than one factor of security, if not else but to give you peace of mind for the coming years.

The main reason for bringing this up is to ward off potential `adversaries`, as a soon-to-be prominent online business, you will have many would-be attackers that seek to take you offline or breach your security to gain access to both funds as well as confidental user information. A very simple fix to this has already been put in place by both myself and {this.company} through the use of 32-bit and SSL encryptions on your [Log-In](www.google.com) and [Checkout](www.google.com) sections, as well as your storage database. However, this is not always enough to stop a savvy hacker.

I suggest you use a few personal `mitigation` techniques that will offer another layer of protection for both you and your company. Using a 2-Factor authentication for your personal log-in when maintaining your website at {this.company} will help disuade many would-be attackers, and will help ward against possible password theft through different `attack vectors` such as using public computers or the same password across multiple websites. It's also highly recommend that you change your password frequently, and then store it in a safe encrypted place like [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - The account is free and the safety it provides is invaluable to someone in your position.

It was a pleasure working with you on this project. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors, and the utmost success in your business going forwards. If you enjoyed my work, be sure to recommend me to friends or other clients you will have in the future.

Cheers,
Kevin Jolley
