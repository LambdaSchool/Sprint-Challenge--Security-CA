##Threat Modal##
Boss comes in saying :
  We have been hacked, I cant get to my account, what are we going to do?
  
So threat analysis takes over and we begin to think of all of the possibilities. 

Employee :
  Let me check the servers, and we will see what up.
  

Where do we start looking for the problem, have we actualy been comprimised or was it some other cause that made it so the boss could not gain access to his/her account.

First, we check out our account,
  A) Everything looks normal, maybe its just the bosses account.
      i) Let's check access logs
      ii) Try to reset the bosses account.
  B) Oh, Boy Can't access my account either... May have a real problem here
      i) Check the servers are up and running and see if local connections are available. 
      ii) Oh Boy we might better tellt he boss there is a problem

Scenerio One
Employee :  
Boss, i reset your password, seems you tried to many times.. I changed it to easy123 you will need to reset it once you login!

Boss :
Hey Thanks I have so many I always for get this one.

Scenerio Two

Employee :  
Boss, the password easy123 was used to access your account, and we have found the individual has access your files. We will need to reset your password, and do further security testing.

Boss :
Who's account was that, I thought we have better security.

Employee :  
Uhh Boss, the password easy123 was used to access your account.
We told you to reset your password, once you logged in, but we have updated your password to NotSo$easy123ThanksBoss and we will change it as a regular part of security updates.

Boss:
Ok, well get me some coffee!
