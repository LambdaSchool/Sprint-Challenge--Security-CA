Your name is Mr. Big Idea and you've been dispatched to a foreign country to collaberate with a new business partner so that you can launch your company and product there. Your adversaries are many, not only your home countries competitors but also in this new foreign land. You like facial recognition software on your devices and are also introduced to similar software in this foreign country through software that the locals use and is key to your success, not to be ignored. You have a lot of friends and people who want to work with you to make the business succeed.

In this country, company espionage is unbound and protected by the government unlike in your free country.
