Hi Kathy,

I've had a chance to review the client's security threats and below you'll find a quick threat model analysis. 

  * Adversaries - Rival celebrities, fans of rival celebrities, unhappy employees, criminals and fanatics

  * Attack surface - social media accounts

  * Attack vectors - Through family, friends, employees, and online communication with fans, surveillance, 

  * Risks - Availability (client is not maintaining software updates), confidentiality (multiple employees have access to passwords), integrity (minimal use of data verification software)

  * Types of Attack -  DoS attack from not maintaining software updates, man-in-the-middle attack through family, friend, and/or employees, backdoor/malware/ransomware,  and social media

  * Mitigation - Update phone hardware and software regularly, limit number of employees with access to accounts and limit their account access privileges, use different passwords for different social media accounts, use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with family, friends, and employees

As mentioned before, the security team can begin improving the client's security as soon as possible. Let me know if you have any questions.

Best Regards,
