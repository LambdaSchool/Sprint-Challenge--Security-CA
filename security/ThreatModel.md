We as human beings, will get contact with multiple media when addressing daily issues, such as bank systems that provide financial services, internet that provides informational communication, and paper-based documentation achieves that provide essential proof or statment, etc. All of these media play significant roles to make our life easier handling personal or commercial events. However, it also brings up a huge concern of information security and a endless talk on how to protect all the sensitive information in such highly interactive environment.

Here I will discuss the factors that get involved in security world:

1.  Attack surface: basically the media the may expose people's information to open environment. I mentioned several media in the previous paragraph such as: bank systems, computers connecting with world wide web, paper-based documents that are transferred among recipients, payment devices that associated with third party financial agencies, etc.

2.  Adversaries: people or entities that are chasing the information for any interests. These could include: those who counterfeit any bank card to make profit, those who use top secret information to make diplomatic compromise, those who will prevail in the competition among competitiors, etc.

3.  Attack factors: mainly the methods are used to threaten security. These could contain: password theft and cracking, surveillance, information counterfeit and misuse, software malfunctions that expose information, mishandling sensitive information, etc.

4.
