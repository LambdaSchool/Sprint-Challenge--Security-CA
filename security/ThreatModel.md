Jim -

  Some of the syber security procedures and systems in place concern me and I would like to voice my concerns. 

  Firstly, our system holds a great deal of valuable information, as I am sure you are aware, and it needs to be protected to the best of our ability. One suggestion I have to reduce risk would be, in addition to the current one password for everyone system, separate into a user password in addition to the system password. This adds a second wall of passwords needed to break through which helps with password cracking hack methods.

  Secondly, the entrance to the building is not very secure. While there is a basic lock and an alarm system, there are no cameras and the doors are glass. To reduce risk the most, I would suggest at a minimum reinforcing the glass, and using a stronger lock system. This could be something like keypad entry combined with the key so it cannot be picked. Most ideal would be a solid door combined with reinforced lock system. 

  Lastly, having access to work software from home computers is my greatest concern. I would suggest complete separation of work and personal life and implement strict rules for employee software usage. Possibly issuing work computers so that work away from the office is possible, while security can be maintained and monitored by the company as needed.

  These are just a few suggestions to reduce the risk of loss for the company I admire working for.
