## To my dear friend,

As you know, we live in a world where more and more of our lives are being transposed into the digital space, and with every passing byte, we become more suseptible to becoming the victims of cyber attacks. Because of this, it is imperative that we be weary of where and how we leave our digital footprints.

As of late, I have learned a few practical bits of information on the subject of security, and would like very much to share them with you.

### Attack Vectors
An Attack Vector is a particular path within a computer or network that those with mallicous intent can use to spread harmful software. The Vector can be in the form of a virus, an opened email attachment, a pop-up page, or many other shady areas of the internet. I implore you to install an extension, such as DuckDuckGoose, which will rate the security of every site before visiting, and also to enact some sort of pop-up blocking while you browse the web.

### Attack Surfaces
An Attack Surface is essentially an entry point for a Vector to do it's damage. Best Practices dictate that you should keep the Attack Surface of any software you're developing as small as possible.

### Mitigations
Some of these risks can be mitigated by the use of the technologies I've metioned above, as well as practical additions such as adding 2 factor authentication to your projects, adding a password manager to store all of your passwords (which should be different for every site, by the way), or securing your Github by setting up SSH access or adding GPG to sign commits.

I hope that the above information finds you well, and leads to a safe, and productive time coding and browsing the web.

All the best,

Charlie
