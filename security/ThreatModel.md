Dear Sir Madam;

It has come to my attention that there are threat risks on the website that holds your clients personal information.

There are people who are willing to hack and compromise personal information. There is just a simple login form with no password encryption so I would recommend using a third party app to ensure protection. Also, I would highly recommend a password manager and to complete your 2-factor authentication for when you are logging in.

If we are not careful, there are people's information that can be at risk. Thank you for being mindfull of users's information.
