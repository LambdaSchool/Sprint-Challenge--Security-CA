Although it makes life easier at first glance to use simple, short, or an already used password, this is the quickest way to lose all your personal information on the web. Hackers can use a variety of methods to gain access to your personal accounts online. Brute force is one of the main ways to crack passwords. If your login info was in a leaked database then it'll compromise all of your future accounts using the same credentials. Even if the said hacker were to use a program to help them crack a password, password lengths of less than 8 characters can be cracked in as little as 5 hours, while passwords longer than 9 characters can take atleast 5 days. Everyone with a bank account or some presence online is vunerable to this type of attack. Hackers usually just want the bank information or just an email to sell to an email marketer. Best practice is to use long passwords that only you, and only you can know. Using a password manager is good too, but you do really trust some app to store and securely hold all your passwords?
