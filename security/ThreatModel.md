Dear coworker,

The internet of 2018 can be a dangerous place.  The threats are not always self-evident. Criminals and pranksters continue to invent new ways to attack. They can compromise your security, privacy and productivity if you aren't careful.  That's why I'm writing you. I want you to be as safe as possible from these threats while still enjoying all that is now available to us.

Zero exposure to cyber security threats is no longer possible in 2018. Almost every appliance, vehicle, accessory, and phone is "smart."  Smart TV's and phones etc. are nothing more than a point of entry to a criminal.

So why does it matter if someone can crack your password?  Authentication blocks access to data that may not be safe to share with everyone.  The data could be as simple as what food or movies you like. But criminal organizations and spy agencies use those demographics for social engineering.  There are, of course, data that are more important to secure. For example, adversaries might use your location to harm you. They might use your financial information to steal from you. Your health information could allow them to discriminate against you or threaten your physical safety. 

What are some things you can do to mitigate your exposure to these threats?  An unbreakable system doesn't exist. But, you can use certain strategies to increase your safety. Thinking of your security credentials as a phrase and not only a word increases your security exponentially. When you use these devices at home it's important that anything that has a login has a unique passphrase.   Many devices are capable of using other approaches like 2-factor authentication, or fingerprint or face scan. Using a multi-pronged approach to security is your best practice. Using software to store and generate random passwords can help you keep your pass phrases unique. There is of course a major downside to this approach.  If someone cracks your password manager then you are just as exposed as if your password for every device or service was the same. Whatever strategies you use, it is important to at least have a strategy, because they certainly have a strategy for you.
