Hi Mary,

Here are my thoughts after we talked recently about your personal online security. You're right in that you're not a "high-value target" as you don't have access to any major corporate or government accounts or such, but there is still value to a hacker in gaining access to your accounts or systems. Their purpose could be something as simple as blocking access to your data in order to blackmail you or they could want to add your devices to their botnet that they uses for nefarious purposes such as attacking others without your knowing that your computer is involved.

Your greatest area of risk is the fact that you use the same username and password on multiple sites and that you sometimes swap them, which means both your username and password are available in non-encrypted forms online. If someone probes multiple accounts they could easily discover your pattern and gain full access to your accounts.

The first thing that I recommend is that you change every one of your logins, both the username and the password, to new ones that you've never used before. Do not swap them back and forth again, as that will put you at risk again. A better step would be to start using a password manager that can generate random, strong passwords for you and track them so you don't need to do it. This increases the security of every one of your accounts. If you want to take it even further you could add two-factor authentication to accounts that support it. This means an additional security step is needed aside from entering a username and password. It's a little less convenient but the security benefit is huge.

I'd be glad to talk with you further and help you set things up if you want!
