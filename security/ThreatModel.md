    Things to consider are attack surfaces (what), adversaries (what), attack vectors (how), mitigations (decrease the risk).

<br>
<br>
    Attack surface can be any tech that you use. More importantly those things that are easily seen by others. That could include social media, banking, and email.
<br>
<br>
    Adversaries are the who. That is that person or persons that are willing to compromise your security. Whether it is for criminal reasons (hacking banking info) or someone just trying to play a particle joke.
<br>
<br>
    Attack Vectors are the mode in which your adversaries are willing to compromise your information. There are many avenues in which this can be done (i.e - password thief, surveillance...etc).
<br>
<br>
    Mitigation are the ways one will set up a defense against these said adversaries and attacks (What can be done to reduce my risk).
