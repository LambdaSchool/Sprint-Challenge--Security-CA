## Letter
Mr. Scott,

    I have noticed quite a few emails from you lately that look rather insecure. While we have a casual atmosphere here at work, I would like to remind you that you still need to be careful of what you are sending through email. There have been 5 emails that included 'phishing' scams. If you do not know what phishing is, it is a cyber _attack vector_; method of taking your account info and passwords in a way that makes it seem like you are logging into a normal website. The main _attack surface_ for phishing is by email, so you cannot trust every email that comes into your inbox. There are a lot of _adversaries_ like criminals and hackers that want access to any information they can ge their hands on. Once they get your password, it becomes much easier to steal you identity, personal information, and even financial information or money.
    To _mitigate_ this, I would definitely suggest to stop using your company email for personal use. This is a professional environment, so lets keep it that way. If you do not open emails that sound too good to be true, or they sound very suspicious, mark them as spam right away or delete them. A few people in the office have had their information taken through phishing, so we need to address this immediately and prevent it from happening again. Please reply to this email and confirm with me that you have read it.

Thank you,
John Correia
