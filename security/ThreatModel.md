Dear John Doe,

    We need to address and potential security flaw. I've
noticed that some of our employees have been exposing our company to potential compromises of customer information. We can't afford to have this info to be exposed, as any leak or exposure could compromise our position in the current market, and potentially expose customers to malicious acitivies. 

    Our employess have not been updating their passwords every
six weeks, have been taking their work home with them, and communicating customer information through insecure means. We need to correct this behavior. I suggest we hold a series of security meetings to explain the proper way to handle customer data and explain the dangers of their current habits to our customers and our company. 

Thanks you for your time,
Christopher Stone
