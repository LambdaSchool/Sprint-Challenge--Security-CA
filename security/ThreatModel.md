Craig,

As you are the regional sales director for Company, here are some steps you should take in order to prevent a security breach.

Because Company is in an area with a lot of competition, people working for other resorts in the area would benefit greatly from access to your data. Even someone working at Company who may be leaving to work for another company would have motive to steal your data: they could steal thousands of leads and bring them to another company.

There are many things you can do to secure your data.

One very important thing is to use different, secure passwords for everything you need to log in to. Make sure to not use something that can easily be guessed, such as 1234 or your name. You can use password management software to keep track of all of your passwords, as well as generate secure passwords. This way, you only need to remember one password to log in to the software. Make sure that you do not write down any passwords or login information, as that is one of the best ways for someone to gain access to your accounts.

Always lock your office door when you leave, even if you're only leaving for a moment, as well as any cabinets that contain sensitive information.

Lastly, Do not use CompanySoftware on your personal computer or phone, and only access your work email from the computer provided to you by Company. The reason for this is if you have unintentionally or unknowingly acquired malicious software on your personal computer or mobile phone, it may be possible for someone else to gain access to your data.

Thank you!
