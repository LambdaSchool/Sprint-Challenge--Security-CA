Coworker,

Here is the threat model you requested, concerning your grandmother:

The main problem you should worry about for your grandmother is advertisements. Since the majority of websites and apps are based on an advertising model, she will be exposed to clickable advertisements whether she is using her desktop computer, her phone, or her iPad. These are not necessarily harmful, but in my opinion, adware and spyware are synonymous and should be avoided as much as possible.

The prominent threats to your grandmother's security are scammers/spammers, salespeople, and children/grandchildren/great-grandchildren carelessly using her devices. In general, elderly people are more vulnerable to password theft and malicious emails/calls.

Thus, in an ideally secure world, you could:

1. Convince your grandmother to use a Linux desktop computer instead of Windows (Windows is the most targeted because it is the most popular).
2. Install firewall software on all her devices.
3. Install an ad-blocker on whatever browser she uses. Consider installing [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) to secure her entire network from advertisements.
4. Implement biometric security with devices to which family members have frequent access.
5. Instruct her to avoid calls from numbers she does not recognize.

Doing these things is the best way to prevent your grandmother's security from being compromised. Let me know if you have any questions or need additional advice. I'll help in any way I can.

Regards,
-Fellow Coworker.
