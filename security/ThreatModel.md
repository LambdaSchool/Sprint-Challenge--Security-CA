What is a threat model?
A threat model is a risk assessment tool used to identify potential security risks. Once the risks have been identified, the next step is to implement protections to mitigate such risk. Whether it be a company, an application, or even an individual user, everyone needs to protect themselves online. Here's a quick overview of the four main concepts involved in the process:
- Attack surface: areas where you're vulnerable to be targeted. What types of applications/online services are you using? Do you use public wifi? Do you use antivirus protection? Do you use the same password for multiple sites? How much information is publicly available about you online (for someone to gather information on you to have more areas to target)? These things are all important aspects of attack surface. In essence, the more exposure you have to tech, the more potential surface/entry points someone looking to target you would have -- and this segues into our next point:
- Adversaries: who would want to target you? This includes hackers, but it also includes people that may have a grudge against you, or someone envious of you.
- Attack vectors: how the attack will be carried out. There are a number of ways this can be done -- anything from social engineering (example: calling one of your service providers, impersonating you, and taking over your account), to password theft (example: criminal purchases a list of username & passwords to a hacked site, & then they could use that information to target your profile on other sites), to infecting your computer with a virus (such as a keystroke logger), and more.
- Mitigations: How can you reduce your level of risk online? Some examples include: use 2-factor authentication where available, always ensure secure connections to websites where private information is provided, closely monitor email for potential phishing attacks, etc.
