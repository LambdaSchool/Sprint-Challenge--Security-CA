A young person who does everything online but doesnt stay conscious of it is especially vulnerable to everything from phishing attacks to physical theft. Unconcered or more simply, either ignorant or don't care, they won't choose secure passwords or stay cautious when it comes to navigating the internet. We all use adblockers so malicious advertisements are less of an issue, but they may share their netflix password with everyone they know.  That password might be the same one they use at their bank (maybe with an extra _).
