Hi John,

I'm writing to express some concerns about security. More and more data leaks and hacks are occurring through a number of means, and we should do everything possible to limit the amount of exposure we have. With the more information coming out regarding the Facebook - Cambridge Analytica fiasco, the Equifax breach, and more DDoS attacks for ranson happening, we should ensure that our systems, protocols, and employees are as secure as possible. Each one of our employees is a walking security threat. Employees of businesses can be targeted by social engineering, phished, or blackmailed into exposing company IP, personal and private data. We should enable and require two factor authentication for all of our systems. Our business rivals may attempt to obtain access to our systems by sending bad links to employees that install malware, which can log keystrokes, encrypt drives and send them to themselves, find our offer sheets and attempt to poach our employees, and the list goes on. We need to educate all employees about these security risks, and mitigate them by requiring two factor authentication, the use of a password manager and require all passwords be at minimum 30 characters long.

Best,

Zack
