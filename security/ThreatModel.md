Dear <Coworker Name>,

    Thanks for asking me to assess your security practices. I'll break the information down into this thing called a Threat Model:

    Some of your Attack Surfaces (tech you use or places you go that attackers may reach you) would include your social media. Like your instagram and email account. Your adversaries might include some of the employees from the rival firm down the road, and they might have a lot to gain from compromising your information. They could do this in a couple different ways. Since I know you keep some passwords on sticky notes in your office, all they would need is physical access to get your accounts. Your passwords are a little on the short side, as well. 

    You could mitigate these risks by using a digital password manager and destroying those sticky notes. Consider using a "passphrase" instead of a password, as these are harder for computer programs to crack. 


    Thanks!
