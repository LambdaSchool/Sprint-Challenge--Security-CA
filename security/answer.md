### Security Updates

For my security upgrade I have decided to use a password manager.  Currently I use a small notebook to manage my passwords but this can be cumbersome because I don’t always have access to said notebook if for some reason I need to log into something while I’m on the go.  After looking into the various password managers available (obviously not exhaustive, just based on some suggestions), I determined that I did not want a manager that was primarily web based.  I prefer to still have primary control over my password database (with options to keep copies in DropBox and on a USB drive).  As such, I decided to go with KeePassXC.  It is an open source derivative of KeePass Password Safe written in C++ instead of C# so more friendly with non-windows machines (I use Mac).
Downloading and getting KeePassXC up and running was very easy.  The database is very intuitive and easy to use.  I am currently working on getting all my credentials updated and added to the database.  Next step will be to add redundancy by having the database in a few different locations just for safekeeping.
Next step is to ensure I have two-factor authorization enabled everywhere available (I know I’ve gotten this in most locations, but want to verify).
