# What has happend?
A hacker team has used one nurse's password and usename logged into our patients' file manager system, and some patients information was stolen, including patients' SSN, names, home address, etc.

# How could this happen?
One nurse opened a phishing email, which was sent to our hospital mail system, and her username and password was stolen, and then patients information was stolen.

# What should we do?
Our security Department augments spam filters to reduce the phishing emails that reach our system mailbox, and they enhance their monitoring to takedown those phishing websites.
Securied links were sent to everyone to change their password and username, require more complicated password, and added safety image system, which require user to select a personal image, and display this user-selected image with any forms that request a password.
