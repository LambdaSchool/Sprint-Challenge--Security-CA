So this prompted me to finally set-up 2-factor authentication on all my iphone and bank accounts.
I had been putting it off for some time but after going through security, I realized
it was probably in my best interest to get it done to further protect myself. On top of that I 
used a random password generator to help protect both my email and banking accounts to make
that more secure. I made sure to store the password in a place that I could get to if I need it but that would be extremely difficult for anyone else to get to.
