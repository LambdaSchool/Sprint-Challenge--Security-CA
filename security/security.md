I've taken long strides to improve my online security. I have browser extensions that delete cookies every hour; I have a password manager with all of my account passwords that is locked with its own diceware password. All of my accounts contain diceware passwords of over 6 words to protect against any human password guesser, both human and bot. I like to use KeepPass because it's contained to local environment that is my Solid State Drive. I don't trust online password managers because they may be hacked, anything that's online may be hacked regardless of password strength. A database breach is a possibility in many instances.
