* Two Factor Auth: I set up 2 factor authentication for my email. It was easy to set it up. It asks for my phone number as 2nd layer of authentication. So whenever I login to my email, it asks for my phone number as well other than my password. This 2 factor auth protects if my passowrd is hacked or if I stayed logged-in on any other device which I no longer use. I have used 2 factor auth earlier for my bank accounts and other places.

* KeePass: I never store any of my usernames/passwords at one place in the fear that it mght get hacked. As a result, I have to set up new password whenever I forgets the old password. I likes KeePass password manager. It encrypts the file where all the username and passwords are stored. This file can have a master password to keep it even more protected. Thus, a safer option to save my credentials at one place. KeePass also has the 2 factor authentication option. I havn't set that up yet.
