# My new security setup

    I have to admit that I have never used a password manager in my life. I would simply write them 
down on a notepad and have them saved locally on a browser. While it works for the most part, one of the downsides is that over the years, the amount of passwords I have to maintain made it more difficult to maintain notepad documents and sometimes can get lost. So, I decided to give password managers a try. I don't think I feel comfortable using one that store things into a cloud because of concerns over databases potentially being hacked but the least I could do is to start with a local one. This is the main reason why I went with KeePass. 

One of the downsides is that it doesn't have the convenience of a cloud based password manager of easy access on all devices and I do have multiple. Therefore, I decide to also use drop box in order be able to transfer password to and from multiple devices and it seems to work just fine.
