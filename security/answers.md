Part 2

A great way is to up a password manager. For example LastPass and Keepass
Mking sure that you are not using the same password for evertthing, some sites invariably get the same pwd. And some of them still doesn't have the full commiment in security.

Personally, my husbands works in a Security company so in our house we have to implement a lot of ways to keep everything secure as much as possible. We have a double auth in our internet conecction. We also have an special auth before using bank accounts or importants emails that we need to have secure, talking about emails you can also send encrypted emails so you can share provate information in case that email gets compromise. Is also a good options using sandboxes to store information.

Most of our resources in every day life can be compromise and hacked so is really importat that we as developers help and protect the informations of our users and ours too.
