I use lastpass for all my passwords.

I use two factor auth whenever possible, the most seccure are the ones that require you to enter your phone number or passphase before receiving a text.

I've used VM's to install and test questionable software or for video confencing software that allows the host to spy on my activity (zoom anyone???).

I've used SSH to connect to a Hosted server (ubuntu server) on Linode to upload files to a website.

I'll have to lookinto the other links im more detail later and I've never used a key fob.

I really need to go through the dozens of junk websites and change the passwords for each of those, I'm just using a standard password that I can remember becuase those sites don't store sensitive info.

And lastly I use a website called 10minutemail for some sites that I never want them to have a real email for me.
