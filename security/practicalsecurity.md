### Promotion in a Big Wide Web

Social media gives you the opportunity to market yourself, obtain justice and connect with others. Posting heavy content (images, personal informaion, etc) however, gives advertisers an opportunity to to send you content you may not have been asking for. 

Other users may take your content, (like take a photo and pose as you), and can use your name to phish personal information from those you are connected to and others. Here's how I'm setting up. 

*Security Set Up*

1. Created a last pass account and changed all my passwords
2. SSH github 
3. Last pass account and changed all my passwords
4. Not reusing the same password for too many things.
5. While I am not much of an interest to many, I still should secure my accounts better.
