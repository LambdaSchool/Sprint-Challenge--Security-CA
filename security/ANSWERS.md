### Attack surface

Richard uses a variety of personal electronic devices (phone, tablet, laptop) as well as a work laptop, which he sometimes brings home with him or travels with. All of these devices, as well as any physical correspondence or documents, would be a target due to the sensitive nature of his job.

### Adverseries

Richard would be targetted by a wide variety of adverseries due to his work. This would include, but not be limited to, political adverseries within his own part; political adverseries within other political parties; domestic intelligence agencies; foreign intelligince agencies; private security companies hired by private interests. This is in addition the usual online security threats that affect the average person (phishing, scams, identity theft etc.).

### Attack Vectors

Due to the sensitive nature of his work and the large resources available to many of his potential adversaries, Richard should expect every method available to be used against him.
In addition to remote methods like password cracking, malware, keylogging that target his devices etc, he should also expect more traditional methods such as physical breakins, surveillance, eavesdropping etc.
People close to him may also be targetted as a way to get to him as well. Additionally, he may be used in order to compromise the security of someone else, such as his employer or colleagues, which may be an even higher threat.

### Mitigation

Since some of his adversaries have deep pockets and would have the motives to throw considerable resources towards compromising his security, Richard should assume that his devices will be compromised.

To mitigate this he should keep anything that is hyper-sensitive in hard copies and/or on airgapped machines. Depending on the information, he may even want copies left with trusted individuals (such as a personal attorney) with instructions in the event his personal safety is compromised as 'insurance'. He should hire a thoroughly vetted and trusted security expert check his machines regularly for malware, as well as give recommendations for managing his security on his personal devices (password management, encryption etc.).

He should use encrypted communications with machines not associated with him (i.e. purchase of machine cannot be traced back to him) for highly sensitive communication. At the same time he should maintain appearances with his regular devices. If someone is surveilling him and notices a lack of normal activity they will be more inclined to look more deeply. 'Security through obscurity' is also a concept Richard regularly employ since he should assume that he is, or can be, compromised.
