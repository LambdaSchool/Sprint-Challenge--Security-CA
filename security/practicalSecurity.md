#Practical Security

Probably the most important thing i did here was change my computer password from a 10 character long, only lowercase letter password to a 12 character lowercase, uppercase, number and special character password. I already have many different passwords for different things but having them all saved in my keypass with my old simple password made it all kinda pointless.
Another thing i did was make my github more secure with SSH and GPG. Though I'm not too worried about someone accessing my github, I did it for practice and will be developing this good habit for later down the line.
