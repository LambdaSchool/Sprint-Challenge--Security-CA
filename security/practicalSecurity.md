# Part 2 - Practical Security
After you do some of the above, turn in a file `PracticalSecurity.md` with 1-2
paragraphs summarizing what you did (remember, a good security setup doesn't
depend on security through obscurity, so it should be safe to talk about it as
long as you don't share actual passwords/secrets). As a stretch goal, write a
blog post about your security setup describing what youâ€™ve learned and tips you
have for others.
I ended up downloading keePass.  I will be honest I tend to shuffle through 4-5 passwords that I have been using for years.  I have a hard time remembering passwords. Sometimes I do write them down but I hide the paper.  I think keePass will be useful to me because now I can make more complex passwords.  My husband who is Applications Admin is always after me to vary my passwords.  But I think I am like a lot of people, the simpler the password the easier it is to remember.  But the easier the password the easier it can be cracked.  I have had my email and Facebook hacked once or twice.  But lately I have been thinking about my security and how vulnerable I am.  Hopefully keePass will be a good start.
